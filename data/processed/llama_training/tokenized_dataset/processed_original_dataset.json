This driven and resourceful CPA dreams of one day dining with Bill Gates, but money isn\u2019t his top priority; friends and family come first. He\u2019s seriously smart though, with a 3.9 HS GPA and a BA in business. He has a friendly smile, high cheekbones and a 6-foot frame he keeps fit by running. His big, happy Vietnamese family is healthy too, with grandparents living into their 80s and 90s. Oh \u2014 and he also gardens, raises chickens, and makes a mean tiramisu. Is there anything this donor can\u2019t do?!\n\n### End",

He closely identifies with his mother who instilled a strong work ethic as well as the importance of being kind. He loves to travel and plan his next adventure. Being outdoors hiking and building with Legos are favorite hobbies. Our staff likes his sense of humor. The first thing you notice about him is his thick well-groomed mustache. He has a strong and wide-shouldered build. His full head of thick dark brown hair is complimented nicely by his warm hazel eyes.

There\u2019s just something about. Standing at 6\u20191\u201d, his deep-brown eyes and dimpled smile (which some say resemble Josh Hartnett\u2019s) instantly draw you in, but it\u2019s his confidence and humor that truly impresses. Off the record, this donor has plenty of reasons to brag. Aside from his bilingual Spanish skills, athleticism, and successful career in sports therapy, he has a talent for making friends everywhere he goes. One clear testament to this: he\u2019s been the best man in three weddings and counting.\n\n### End",

Off the record, this donor has plenty of reasons to brag. Aside from his bilingual Spanish skills, athleticism, and successful career in sports therapy, he has a talent for making friends everywhere he goes.

There\u2019s something refreshingly old school yet progressive about. This certified emergency medical technician is a man of honor whose word is his bond. Cheerful, with a beautiful smile, he was an easygoing, bilingual (English/Spanish) child who fell in love with soccer as soon as he could walk. Turns out he was a natural athlete who later became the team captain. Today, he uses boxing to keep fit. Writing poetry, reading serious literature, and playing piano are his favorite ways to relax.\n\n### End",

Now in their mid-thirties and thriving in their career as a physiotherapist, they balance a deep love for their own family with an eagerness to help others experience the same joy. Standing tall with an athletic build; a passion for swimming, climbing, and solo sports. Their family is notably competitive and shares a robust, energetic spirit, with a love of physical activity that spans generations. Kind, considerate, and naturally curious, they embrace a world of diverse interests, from the depths of science fiction and fantasy to discussions on philosophy and life\u2019s deeper questions. They have carved out a respected role as a leader in their field. This mix of intellect, warmth, and athleticism defines their character. With a rich multicultural upbringing and a love of both family and friendship, they offer not only an impressive genetic profile but also a generous heart and a genuine desire to make a difference.. \"Why I decided to become a donor: it was not something that I had thought of until I spoke with friends struggling to have children and the difficulty, they had finding donors. It made me reflect on my own situation and how much joy having my own family has brought me, and I realised that there were couples out there who needed help starting their family and I was in a position to offer that help.\"\n\n### End",

This donor holds a strong belief in the importance of family, friends, and close relationships, crediting them for much of their success and personal growth. They have a particular fondness for animals, especially dogs, and enjoy their company - often dog sitting whenever possible. With a good sense of humour, they cherish the joy of laughter and the ability to make others smile, reflecting their warm and caring nature. Their personality is marked by kindness, empathy, and a preference for meaningful connections. As a child, they were shy yet curious, traits that have carried into their adult life, where they prefer a well-planned approach to life rather than rushing into things. They take pride in their persistence and the niche they have carved out in their profession, showing a determination to excel despite obstacles. Though naturally introverted, they can adapt to be more outgoing when necessary, both personally and professionally.. To the donor conceived child: \"I hope for you to be healthy and happy throughout your life, and I will be sending you all the love in my heart. You may never get to know me, but I will think of you every day, and I will be sending you love regardless.\"\n\n### End",

This donor holds a strong belief in the importance of family, friends, and close relationships, crediting them for much of their success and personal growth. They have a particular fondness for animals, especially dogs, and enjoy their company - often dog sitting whenever possible. With a good sense of humour, they cherish the joy of laughter and the ability to make others smile, reflecting their warm and caring nature. Their personality is marked by kindness, empathy, and a preference for meaningful connections. As a child, they were shy yet curious, traits that have carried into their adult life, where they prefer a well-planned approach to life rather than rushing into things. They take pride in their persistence and the niche they have carved out in their profession, showing a determination to excel despite obstacles. Though naturally introverted, they can adapt to be more outgoing when necessary, both personally and professionally.. To the donor conceived child: \"I hope for you to be healthy and happy throughout your life, and I will be sending you all the love in my heart. You may never get to know me, but I will think of you every day, and I will be sending you love regardless.\"",

Their passion for learning and helping people has driven them towards a PhD in healthcare, where their hard-working and inquisitive spirit shines. Outside of their academic pursuits, they enjoy keeping active with sports and express their creative side through painting. They also have a surprising talent for dancing, adding a fun and playful dimension to their well-rounded character. This donor\u2019s warmth, dedication, and diverse interests make them a truly special individual, and they\u2019re excited about the possibility of helping others grow their families.. \"What I like about myself is that I am not afraid of failure, and I believe in myself. I know that I am not the best at everything, but I am a very persevering individual, and I take the time that is needed to learn or achieve what I want.\"",

As a child, they were curious and adventurous, always eager to explore their surroundings. This sense of wonder has continued into adulthood, where they enjoy outdoor activities like hiking and cycling, alongside hobbies such as painting, photography, and playing the guitar. Their creative side is matched by a strong work ethic and a determination to achieve their goals, reflected in their entrepreneurial career. Family is at the heart of this donor's life, offering a solid foundation of love and support. They share a close bond with their younger sister, who remains their best friend. Physically, they are tall and athletic, with dark hair and brown eyes, and they take pride in their smile, a feature inherited from their mother. Whether diving into a new book, experimenting in the kitchen, or pursuing innovative ideas in business, this donor is committed to making a positive impact on the world and enjoying the everyday moments that matter most.. \"I chose to become a sperm donor to give someone else the opportunity to become a parent because I understand the profound impact and joy that parenthood can bring to a person's life. I wanted to help those who may face challenges in starting a family and provide them with a chance to experience the love, growth, and fulfillment that comes from raising a child.\"\n\n### End",

Academically gifted from a young age, they went on to earn a PhD from one of the world\u2019s top universities, leading to a prestigious career in public service where they represent the UK on an international stage. Their multicultural roots, with Ecuadorian and Spanish influences, shine through in their love for cooking South American dishes, dancing to Latino music, and spending time with family. Always seeking new experiences, they stay active through calisthenics, swimming, and photography expeditions to remote landscapes. Driven by a genuine desire to make a positive impact, they volunteer to address racial inequalities and support disadvantaged communities, making them a truly thoughtful and well-rounded choice.. \"I have seen people close to me struggle to have a family for reasons completely out of their control. I have friends who are LGBTQ+ who I know would create loving families but are obviously biologically not able to start a family.\"\n\n### End",

Academically gifted from a young age, they went on to earn a PhD from one of the world\u2019s top universities, leading to a prestigious career in public service where they represent the UK on an international stage. Their multicultural roots, with Ecuadorian and Spanish influences, shine through in their love for cooking South American dishes, dancing to Latino music, and spending time with family. Always seeking new experiences, they stay active through calisthenics, swimming, and photography expeditions to remote landscapes. Driven by a genuine desire to make a positive impact, they volunteer to address racial inequalities and support disadvantaged communities, making them a truly thoughtful and well-rounded choice.. \"I have seen people close to me struggle to have a family for reasons completely out of their control. I have friends who are LGBTQ+ who I know would create loving families but are obviously biologically not able to start a family.\"",

From the start he was very interested in getting to know the members of staff he interacted with. He has a warm countenance and was always enthusiastic, bringing joy with every visit. One of his passions is languages; communication is incredibly important to him which was evidenced in the way he spoke openly to staff. This donor loves new experiences, whether that be foods to try, new travel destinations to explore or people to meet. His desire to help people can be seen through his career in teaching. He decided to become a donor as he doesn\u2019t currently want his own children, but wants to help those that do\".\n\n### End",

He is an open book - enthusiastic about sharing his life, making him easy to talk to. Tall with an athletic build, he is an avid gym-goer. He is an adventurous thrill-seeker, always looking for a new challenge or place to explore. He has recently bought a home in London and is enjoying decorating and furnishing it. Suffering a serious injury some years ago renewed his appreciation and love for life. During his long recovery, he gained a new respect for all the people that helped him. He now wants to do all that he can to help others.\"\n\n### End",

Passionate about music, AI, and linguistics, they\u2019ve mastered multiple languages, play the guitar, and have a black belt in karate. Their love for travel has taken them around the world, including memorable stints in Japan and Australia. Their upbringing instilled a strong work ethic, with high academic expectations leading them to excel in school and eventually pursue a career in artificial intelligence, blending their passions for technology and human behaviour. While their academic journey began with a focus on STEM subjects, they\u2019ve since embraced a wider range of interests, from history to theatre. Having lived in several countries, they thrive on new experiences and personal growth. Now working in their dream job, they enjoy combining their varied interests with cutting-edge AI projects, all while staying connected to friends from around the globe. This donor's path reflects a balance of ambition, creativity, and a drive to continually evolve.. \"[I decided to donate] because I am probably not going to raise my own child to focus more on my career. I would like to help people who would like to have a child.\"\n\n### End",

As a child, they were cheerful and energetic but became more serious and sensitive when they started studying. Their curiosity led them to develop a strong interest in science, astronomy, and photography. As a student they received a scholarship which brought them to London, where they faced initial challenges but grew stronger and met their now-wife, who they have been with for many years. Balancing a busy career with family life was challenging, but being present for their children\u2019s births and cherishing family time was always a priority. Seeking to give back, they decided to donate to the London Sperm Bank to help others create families.. \"Being a parent is a wonderful gift and it makes me upset to think that some people may be deprived of it, through no fault of their own.\"\n\n### End",

As a child, they were cheerful and energetic but became more serious and sensitive when they started studying. Their curiosity led them to develop a strong interest in science, astronomy, and photography. As a student they received a scholarship which brought them to London, where they faced initial challenges but grew stronger and met their now-wife, who they have been with for many years. Balancing a busy career with family life was challenging, but being present for their children\u2019s births and cherishing family time was always a priority. Seeking to give back, they decided to donate to the London Sperm Bank to help others create families.. \"Being a parent is a wonderful gift and it makes me upset to think that some people may be deprived of it, through no fault of their own.\"",

He is a man of discovery which was brought on by his travels throughout his early childhood. This helped develop his curious mind and strong interest in science fiction and literature.

Overall this donor is intellectual, calm and caring, with an optimistic outlook on self-development and life itself.\n\n### End",

Perfect for anyone seeking a donor who embodies both intellectual brilliance and a love for the finer things in life.. \"I want to help people who want children and are unable to for any reason. I am also a blood, platelets, and plasma donor. Helping others is what motivates me.\"\n\n### End",

Now in their mid-thirties and thriving in their career as a physiotherapist, they balance a deep love for their own family with an eagerness to help others experience the same joy. Standing tall with an athletic build; a passion for swimming, climbing, and solo sports. Their family is notably competitive and shares a robust, energetic spirit, with a love of physical activity that spans generations. Kind, considerate, and naturally curious, they embrace a world of diverse interests, from the depths of science fiction and fantasy to discussions on philosophy and life\u2019s deeper questions. They have carved out a respected role as a leader in their field. This mix of intellect, warmth, and athleticism defines their character. With a rich multicultural upbringing and a love of both family and friendship, they offer not only an impressive genetic profile but also a generous heart and a genuine desire to make a difference.. \"Why I decided to become a donor: it was not something that I had thought of until I spoke with friends struggling to have children and the difficulty, they had finding donors. It made me reflect on my own situation and how much joy having my own family has brought me, and I realised that there were couples out there who needed help starting their family and I was in a position to offer that help.\"\n\n### End",

Now in their mid-thirties and thriving in their career as a physiotherapist, they balance a deep love for their own family with an eagerness to help others experience the same joy. Standing tall with an athletic build; a passion for swimming, climbing, and solo sports. Their family is notably competitive and shares a robust, energetic spirit, with a love of physical activity that spans generations. Kind, considerate, and naturally curious, they embrace a world of diverse interests, from the depths of science fiction and fantasy to discussions on philosophy and life\u2019s deeper questions. They have carved out a respected role as a leader in their field. This mix of intellect, warmth, and athleticism defines their character. With a rich multicultural upbringing and a love of both family and friendship, they offer not only an impressive genetic profile but also a generous heart and a genuine desire to make a difference.. \"Why I decided to become a donor: it was not something that I had thought of until I spoke with friends struggling to have children and the difficulty, they had finding donors. It made me reflect on my own situation and how much joy having my own family has brought me, and I realised that there were couples out there who needed help starting their family and I was in a position to offer that help.\"",

Their passion for fitness keeps them active, while their love of socialising brings a sense of balance to their life. They thrive in both professional settings and personal relationships, always finding new ways to connect with others and pursue their goals. Their blue-green eyes and light brown hair enhance their approachable, friendly nature. Ambitious, intelligent, and warm, they offer a unique combination of drive and charisma that stands out.. \"[I decided to become a donor] Because I am in same-sex relationship and would require egg donation for myself, I believe its a virtuous cycle that I should support and help people with sperm donation.\"\n\n### End",
