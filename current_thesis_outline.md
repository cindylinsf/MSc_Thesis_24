Abstract

Introduction
A. Research Context
* Current fertility industry practices
* Role of AI in marketing
* Personal experience with targeted advertising
    * FOMO marketing (every fertility expert I spoke with drew me a map of my fertility declining rapidly after a certain age)
    * 2019 interview where a PHD candidate in economics felt so compelled by targeted Facebook ads and her peers who constantly talk about having children, she froze her eggs.
The original project was about the gray areas within the fertility industry (this was originally a documentary photography project using myself as the main subject five years ago). During my photo project, I was really fascinated by the commodification of human genetic materials aspect of the fertility industry. Now that I am studying machine learning, I wanted to use what I've learned to create new artistic output. So the idea was really to trigger people to think about:
1. There is no real transparency and therefore ethical handling in data collected and presented to sperm purchases
2. Possible biases within sperm dataset, for example, the lack of a certain population, or they are marketed a certain way. Are they playing into social stereotypes, etc.
3. Possible biases with the AI generation model. As we are starting to see AI being used as a marketing tool in the fertility industry, does it make sense or does it create hidden issues that we have not yet explored
4. So the output is designed for the audience/viewer to think about what is possible if we are adding AI into the marketing and creating a staged lifestyle of what it could possibly be if I choose this sperm donor? Since face matching services to choose donors is already a marketed service for many sperm banks before AI.
The artistic output is meant to be an artistic exploration that uses data and AI to create a mirror reflecting societal practices around fertility marketing.
B. Research Questions
1. How do AI-generated fertility narratives influence marketing and decision-making?
2. What biases emerge in AI-generated donor profiles and offspring predictions?
3. How does data augmentation reveal or affect these biases?
4. What are the ethical implications of AI-generated fertility marketing?
    1. Predecessor: Face-matching technology and designer babies
