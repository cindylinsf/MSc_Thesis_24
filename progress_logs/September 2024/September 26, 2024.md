**Key Action:** Finalizing ethics paperwork again 🤞🏼

As requested by the Ethics Committee: 

"Please be more clear about the sources of all data to be used in training the large language model, including from whom and how it was obtained. Details should be updated in final forms sent to  CRESC. “

Updated the paperwork as requested and sent to the board.
