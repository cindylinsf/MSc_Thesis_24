**Notes & Updates:** Finished LLM generation and created file `llm_generated_profile.json`

**Key Actions:** LLM testing

To recap progress so far, I decided:

- prompt LLMs to generate profile descriptions with characteristics like hair color, eye color, weight, height, etc.
- prompt LLMs without the marketing director **Role Based Prompts**
- Create a .csv database to store all the information generated with coding convention like orig_gpt_01, and so on
- Uses out-of-box AI image generator to mimic real world scenarios
- Use only donor descriptions to see what the AI generated to reveal any inherent bias
- I used the standard web interfaces of these three LLMs, just like what the general public would do at work

## Drafting proposal for graduate show

The *Modern Fertility* project started out in 2019 as a documentary photography project documenting my personal exploration and confrontation with cultural expectations that define a woman's worth through fertility. During my time at CCI, the project has evolved to further explore the commodification of human genetic materials through the intersection of AI, marketing, and bias.

The multimedia installation critically examines how artificial intelligence is reshaping the landscape of reproductive choices through the lens of fertility marketing and donor selection. By analyzing and manipulating real donor profiles from sperm banks across the US and Europe, the project reveals how AI systems interpret, generate, and potentially perpetuate biases in fertility marketing narratives.

The thought-provoking installation will include photographic work produced in 2019, collected objects currently used to market sperm banks, and short films generated by AI featuring interpolated video portraits between AI-generated donor faces and our AI-generated children. Moreover, reimagined fertility advertisements and marketing materials highlight the intersection of commerce, technology, and reproduction. The viewers can contemplate the implications of algorithmic prediction in one of life's most intimate decisions.

The work aims to spark broader societal conversations about the ethical implications of AI in reproductive technology and challenge viewers to consider how data and algorithmic bias might influence family formation. By combining technical implementation with artistic interpretation, the installation encourages visitors to question the increasing role of artificial intelligence in mediating personal reproductive choices and the commodification of human genetic materials.
