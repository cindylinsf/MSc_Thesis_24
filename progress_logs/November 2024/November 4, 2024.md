# Thesis Outline

## I. Introduction
### A. Research Context
- Current fertility industry practices
- Role of AI in marketing
- Personal experience with targeted advertising and this topic

### B. Research Questions
How do AI-generated, personalized fertility narratives blur the boundaries between reality and aspiration, and what are the ethical and social implications of this technologically mediated ''staged lived experience''?
- Inherent biases of AI models: What biases emerge in AI-generated donor profiles and offspring predictions?
- Bias within the original dataset: How does data augmentation reveal or affect these biases?
- What are the ethical and social implications of AI-generated fertility marketing?

## II. Technical Background 
### A. Machine Learning Models
1. Large Language Models (LLMs)
   - Architecture overview
   - Text generation capabilities
   - Fine-tuning processes

2. Image Generation Models (possilbe models. Not sure yet)
   - Diffusion models
   - GAN architecture
   - Image-to-image translation

3. Video Generation Technology
   - Frame interpolation
   - Voice synthesis (considering deep faking a celebrity's voice and tune it slightly)

### B. Data Processing
1. Data Collection Methods
   - Web scraping
   - Data cleaning
   - Dataset organization

2. Data Augmentation
   - Techniques
   - Implementation
   - Impact on results

## III. Background & Literature Review
### A. Fertility Industry Analysis
- Current marketing practices
- Lack of transparency in accuracy of presentation of donor profiles
- Loopholes in industry regulations and oversight
- Face matching services
- "It's so easy to buy sperm online, just like on amazon.com"
- Interviews with stakeholders
- Personal experience from 2019

### B. Theoretical Framework
1. Sophie Lewis
- Reproductive markets
- Commodification of fertility
- Family structure critique

2. Heather Dewey-Hagborg
- Biological prediction
- DNA portraiture
- Algorithmic interpretation

3. Hito Steyerl
- Digital image politics
- Technology critique
- Platform capitalism

## IV. Methodology
### A. Dataset Creation & Processing
1. Donor Profile Dataset
   - Demographics
   - Physical descriptions
   - Educational background

2. Goodwill Messages Dataset
   - Content analysis
   - Processing approach

3. Targeted Advertisement Dataset
   - Collection period (2019 and 2024)
   - Print images and short video content like Reels

### B. Generation Process 
1. Text Generation
   - Profile generation
   - Goodwill message processing to create voice-over script creation

2. Image Generation
   - Donor portraits
   - Baby images
   - Offspring photos
   - Marketing materials

3. Video Generation
   - Interpolation techniques
   - Voice synthesis
   - Ad generation

## V. Artistic Output 
### A. Video Works
1. Interpolation of donor children and donors with donors voiceovering the short film
   - Interpolation techniques
   - Voice-over integration
   - Narrative structure
   - Technical process
   - Conceptual framework

2. AI-Generated Fertility Ads (still and Reel like videos)
   - Source material analysis
   - Generation process
   - Marketing narrative
   - Platform specifics

### B. Photographic Works?
1. Still Life Series
   - Previous project integration
   - Conceptual connection

## VI. Results & Analysis
### A. Profile Generation Analysis
- Original vs. Augmented Dataset
    - Demographic distribution
    - Language patterns
    - Narrative structures

- Bias Analysis
    - Persistent patterns
    - Demographic representation
    - Language biases

### B. Visual Generation Analysis
- Donor Images
    - Representation patterns
    - Ethnic diversity
    - Feature analysis

- Generated Offspring
    - Prediction patterns
    - Genetic interpretation
    - Visual biases

- Generated Advertising
    - Original vs. AI-generated ads
    - Marketing narrative and visual presentations

## VII. Critical Discussion
### A. Technical Implementation
1. Model Performance
   - Generation quality
   - Technical limitations
   - Future possibilities

2. Dataset Impact
   - Original vs. augmented results
   - Bias patterns
    - Source data
    - Patterns?
   - Quality factors

### B. Artistic Implementation
1. Medium Choices
   - Video as primary medium
   - Photography integration
   - Marketing materials
    - Differences between targeted ads content in 2019 vs. 2024: In 2019, I was about to turn 40, which made me a prime target for fertility clinics. I also got therapy ads. vs. 2024 the content is a bit different.

2. Narrative Strategy
   - Voice-over implementation
   - Visual progression
   - Viewer engagement

## VIII. Conclusion
