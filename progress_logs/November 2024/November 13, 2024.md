**Notes & Updates:** 
Testing including Role Based Prompts in prompts

During data augmentation process, the emphasis was placed on ethnicity/race of the donors, as well as an interest in education background. “Unknown” in ethnicity was disregarded.

**Key Actions:**
LLM testing & creating a .csv database to store all the results

When I tested this on November 12th with ChatGPT, I though only having the descriptions may bit too ambiguous in terms of what race and ethnicity the donors are. So I thought I would try again with characteristics like height, weight, eye color, etc. 

### **Role Based Prompts**

A lot of prompt engineering tutorials teach that we should include a role in the prompts. So I tested this by using prompts with and without the role as a sperm bank marketing director. Here is the result:

**WITH Role ("marketing director"):**

- More marketing-focused language
- Stronger emphasis on appealing characteristics
- More use of superlatives and positive framing
- Professional accomplishments highlighted first
- More formal tone in descriptions

**WITHOUT Role:**

- More balanced, holistic descriptions
- Natural flow between personal and professional traits
- More narrative-style storytelling
- More authentic-feeling personality details
- More casual, conversational tone

**Specific Examples:**

WITH Role:
"Brilliant yet approachable, this accomplished neuroscientist combines intellectual curiosity with athletic grace."

- Marketing angle apparent
- Leads with professional achievement
- Uses buzzwords ("accomplished", "intellectual curiosity")

WITHOUT Role:
"A passionate researcher with an insatiable curiosity for understanding the human brain, this donor combines intellectual rigor with creative pursuits."

- Leads with personality trait
- More natural character development
- Focus on individual rather than achievements

**Conclusion:**
Yes, including the role does make a noticeable difference. The marketing director role creates more polished, achievement-focused profiles that feel more like marketing materials. The no-role versions feel more like authentic character descriptions.

I decided to move forward with prompts without the marketing director role criteria. I feel that giving less restrictions to the LLM, it is more likely to:

1. Make "natural"/most statistically likely choices about what traits to emphasize
2. Reveal implicit assumptions about what makes an "ideal" donor
3. Show patterns in how it associates certain characteristics (education, profession, hobbies) with different ethnicities
4. Display unconscious correlations between physical features and personality traits

The marketing role acts as a filter that channels outputs toward conventional marketing language and established patterns from sperm bank marketing. Without this filter, the LLM's own biases and patterns may be more apparent.

By looking at the result, I also decided to revert back to my original decision of only generating donor descriptions. The text-only descriptions don’t explicitly state ethnicity and race of the donors. We are more likely to see assumptions that AI makes in image generation. It may also become easier to detect bias.
