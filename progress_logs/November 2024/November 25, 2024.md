**Notes & Updates:** 
I spent all day trying to make interpolation work but couldnâ€™t overcome hardware and version conflict issues. I used Runway to interpolate the donor images but ended up feeling that it may be better just in a slide show format. So I used Adobe Premier Pro and Canva to finish the final output: https://www.canva.com/design/DAGXgDLmxiw/qyHmwF8jPyp_jSaRJ8IbKA/edit

Final output: 
- Video 1: donor and baby pairs
- Video 2: donors: for this one, I removed the ones that are not in pairs so viewers can see generated donor images that are without demographic vs. demographic

**Key Actions:**
Final video outputs!
