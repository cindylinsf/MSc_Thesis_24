**Key Action:** Continue to debug web scraper

The code for bank1 scraper is working, but it is not scraping because of connection time out. It’s either the website owner blocking or the network issue. It’s frustrating.

Today’s goal:
~~🧗🏼 Wrap bank1 scraper TESTING~~
🧗🏼 Start bank3 scraper

✅ Commit scraper_bank1 file. It is finally working!
✅ Scraped 28 profiles so far. Will try to scrape the rest tomorrow. 
✅ Also created scraper_utils.py to mimic more human-like web browsing behaviors
✅ Updated `.gitignore`
