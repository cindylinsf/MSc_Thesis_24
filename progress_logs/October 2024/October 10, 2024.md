**Notes & Updates:** 
Key points about writing thesis:
- Making sure that the thesis topic is aligned with the creative project (or vice versa). Donâ€™t feel compelled that you have to integrate theories
- The paper needs to express why you are doing this project, what was the process of the project and your output.

**Key Action:** 
- Handover meeting with Polo & Rebecca
- Working through Pandas tutorial to get a better sense on data organization
