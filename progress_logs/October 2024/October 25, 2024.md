**Key Action:** Started thesis outline and continue to debug web scraper

It’s really frustrating because I feel like I grossly underestimated how complicated web scraping could be, especially I am dealing with 10 different sites. Progress has been super slow. 

Today’s goal:
🧗🏼 Wrap bank1 scraper TESTING (kept running issues with website timeout. I think maybe the website is blocking me from scraping)
🧗🏼 Start bank3 scraper
~~🧗🏼 Start outline~~


✅ Started outline
✅ Tried a different way to approach scraping bank1, I feel like it had become too complicated. I need to simplify the process.
