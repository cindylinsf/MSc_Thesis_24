**Notes & Updates:** 

**Key Action:** Continue to debug web scraper

Today’s goal:
🧗🏼 Wrap bank1 scraper
🧗🏼 Start bank3 scraper

✅ Created a new shared module called `scraper_utils.py` for reusable components
✅ Researched data cleaning, specially challenges around merging 10 banks’ data that will have variations 
✅ Project objective: Originally, I also wanted to scrape the donor photos. Now I feel that it is best to let models generate images without reference photos to see what AI's assumptions are
✅ In testing phase for bank1 webscraper
