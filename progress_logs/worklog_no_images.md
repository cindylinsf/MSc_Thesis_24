February 11 - June 18, 2023, Portland Art Museum, Oregon

**PRESS RELEASE**

The Portland Art Museum presents the U.S. premiere of¬†*This is the Futur*e, by the filmmaker and writer Hito Steyerl. This exhibition explores a vibrant, imagined garden through an immersive environment of video projection, sculpture, and spatial intervention. Steyerl is one of the foremost artists offering critical reflections on the complexities of the digital world, global capitalism, and the implications of artificial intelligence (AI) for society, which is explored in this exhibition.

**These are documentary images of the future. Not about what it will bring, but about what it is made of.**

Throughout Steyerl‚Äôs career, the acclaimed German artist has interrogated the hidden connections between technology, political movements, and global capitalism, creating contemporary parables that shine a light on the invisible infrastructure established by digital forces such as data mining and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Her works captivate viewers through her nods toward media spectacle and forms of popular entertainment.

Hito Steyerl‚Äôs multimedia installation¬†*This is the Future*, created in 2019, depicts a vibrant, imaginary garden brought to life with video projection and sculpture. With its pulsing soundtrack, dazzling imagery, dark humor, and astute narrative,¬†*This is the Future*¬†explores **the age-old human desire to predict the future and how AI neural networks promise to deliver it to us.**

The exhibition opens with a short film featuring bright colors and fluid, digitally disrupted images. We meet Heja, an incarcerated woman who captures airborne seeds on wadded up paper to cultivate a garden in her cell. She must protect it from the prison guards so she hides it in the future, where her plants evolve through the predictive powers of the neural network. The plants become potent remedies for a range of today‚Äôs social and psychological ailments such as alleviating social media addiction to resisting the culture of over working. Interspersed with Heja‚Äôs story, a second narrator, the voice of a neural network, ponders humanity‚Äôs desire to see and control what is yet to come, ultimately reminding us that despite thousands of years of predictions, no human can escape the inevitability of death. ‚ÄúEntering the future is a massive health hazard,‚Äù according to the narrator.

**ru¬∑der¬∑al (roÕûo‚Ä≤d…ôr-…ôl) n. A plant thrivingin disturbed areas. from Latin r≈´dus,r≈´der-, rubble, broken stones.These floral productions flourish intriumph, upon the ruins of digital disruption.**

The film sets the stage for¬†Power Plants, a series of video sculptures acquired by the Museum through the Contemporary Collectors Circle initiative. Multiple LED screens mounted on steel armatures host colorful and morphing imagery generated by a neural network that predicts a future type of plant based on machine learning of thousands of images of plants. Short texts describe the healing properties of the plants‚Äîwhich seem to grow out of a rocky landscape indicative of the devastating climate crisis‚Äîintended to be future remedies for contemporary social, political, ecological, and technological ills.

Steyerl has described¬†*This is the Future*¬†as a positive look at our future, despite the impending climate crisis and its worsening impact on society. Steyerl imagines a time when plants take on ‚Äúpolitical characteristics or abilities that are able to heal the present‚Ä¶ it is definitely a vision of nature that is more optimistic than the current allows‚Ä¶‚Äù This work proposes that **AI could theoretically be used to create positive effects, something that seems unimaginable in today‚Äôs world of Big Data**. And the exhibition suggests an unexpected pathway toward a resilient future.

**The future starts anew at any moment, this moment is always in the present, this moment is always now**¬†‚ÄîHito Steyerl

*Hito Steyerl: This is the Future*¬†is curated by Sara Krajewski, The Robert and Mercedes Eichholz Senior Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art.¬†*Supported in part by the Contemporary Art Council of the Portland Art Museum,¬†Maribeth Collins Exhibition Endowment Fund, Miller Meigs Endowment for Contemporary Art, and the OCAC Visiting Artist Fund.*

**Notes & Updates:** I feel like I am looking for a man in finance, trust fund, 6'5", blue eyes. 

I took the dataset I created in the NLP class from first term and ran it through LLM models and text-to-image models. The initial test generated very interesting results. They all sound like unrealistic dating profiles.

This particular bank has more flowery descriptions of their donors and I think the result shows.

**Key Action:** Initial test with profiles scraped from NLP class

## Initial test with NLP scraped donors and running it through ChatGPT

### My prompt

- Sample donor profiles scraped from NLP class
    
    6'4'' Soulful Musician
    At 6‚Äô4, with wavy black hair and hazel eyes, this Donor 18784 is a beautiful combination of his Korean mom and Irish dad. He ran varsity track in high school and now stays fit by rock climbing. Currently a college student, he graduated high school with a staggering 4.16 GPA. In his free time, this passionate donor plays drums in a band and writes music. He finds inspiration from human connection and loves cooking for friends. Deep and thoughtful, he believes in banishing regret and releasing what he can't control.
    Poli-Sci Marathoner
    Donor 17858 is the one all of his friends go to for advice. He has a calm, caring personality, a warm smile, and thick shiny hair straight out of a shampoo commercial. A former varsity wrestler, he now runs marathons to stay fit. After falling in love with politics at a young age, he went on to get a poli-sci B.A., and now works as a political consultant. A lifelong foodie, he expresses himself by cooking for friends. Check out his nori chicken recipe in the Express Yourself section of his profile!
    6-Foot CPA
    This driven and resourceful CPA dreams of one day dining with Bill Gates, but money isn‚Äôt his top priority; friends and family come first. He‚Äôs seriously smart though, with a 3.9 HS GPA and a BA in business. He has a friendly smile, high cheekbones and a 6-foot frame he keeps fit by running. His big, happy Vietnamese family is healthy too, with grandparents living into their 80s and 90s. Oh ‚Äî and he also gardens, raises chickens, and makes a mean tiramisu. Is there anything this donor can‚Äôt do?!
    4.0 Adventurer
    This wise donor has one request for future parents: ‚ÄúLife is unpredictable...whoever your child ends up becoming, I hope you support them to be the best possible version of themselves.‚Äù With a 4.0 H.S. GPA and a B.S. in computer science, he's certainly the best version of himself. He‚Äôs also athletic and adventurous, and even took a historic pilgrimage through China alone. Plus, he was prom king, but humbly admits, "It was also a random lottery, haha, so I'm not sure how much that counts."
    Athletic Caretaker
    You might say caring for others is in Donor 18435‚Äôs DNA. With teachers, ministers, and physical therapists in his family, is it any wonder this psychology major has become a certified nursing assistant? The captain of his former high school tennis team, he‚Äôs up for anything that‚Äôs active and sporty. He loves to celebrate the new year with his Korean family, enjoying dumplings ‚Äúfilled with love.‚Äù And he strives to be like an octopus: wise, adaptable, and courageous enough to defend what he loves.
    Born Performer
    After an unforgettable solo backpacking trip in Iceland, Donor 18027's life took an unexpected turn. This outdoor-loving, motorcycle-riding bilingual (English/Tagalog) Eagle Scout with a B.S. in Recreational Management was on the path to becoming a park ranger when the acting bug bit him. Pursuing a full-time acting career was the right move for this born performer, as his amazing hazel eyes, big smile, and impressive natural talent have already earned him a feature film appearance.
    Car-Loving Biz Guy
    Donor 17711 has golden-brown eyes, a charming smile, and a genuine laugh. It would be easy to mistake this outgoing 6‚Äô1‚Äù baseball player for a pro athlete. But he‚Äôs actually a business and marketing major, with a passion for tech and engineering. One of his hobbies is building computers and his passion is cars ‚Äî Japanese imports specifically. He loves Chinese New Year for the food, good fortune, and chance to embrace his Asian culture. He‚Äôs also close to his sister, who always has his back.
    MVP to Med School
    Tall, with beautiful black hair and an infectious smile, Donor 18100 is a true standout.

    Movie-Star Looks. All-Star Talent.
    A talented professional musician, a gifted athlete, and a bit of a philosopher ‚Äì there‚Äôs a lot to this handsome, 6‚Äô1‚Äù guitarist (Adult Photos Available).

A big believer in paying it forward, he volunteers, helping kids with their college applications.

    B-Ball, Books, and the Butterfly Effect

    Slim, with an athletic build and high cheek bones ‚Ä¶ and a doctor?! It‚Äôs true. Donor 17121‚Äôs ambition (he was taking college courses in middle school) led him to his career in medicine. But he‚Äôs also always up for what he calls ‚ÄúType 2‚Äù fun ‚Äî an experience that‚Äôs not fun in the moment but rewarding in retrospect ‚Äî like when he hiked to the top of a volcano.

**Notes & Updates:** Showed work test so far, went over what high-level needs to look like for the thesis. 

**Key Action:** Meeting with Rebecca #3

### Prompt Engineering

- It may be worthwhile to experiment with different prompts, like least attractive, certain traits, etc.

### Discussion

- Results probably would be better with code where I can fine-tune, instead of using out of the box solutions like Gemini, Claude and ChatGPT, etc.

### Thesis paper

- Why I want to work on this project/ research question
- Process & methodology
- My finding / results
- Conclusions, discussions, etc.
- The theories cited in the work needs to *directly* relate to the work itself
- If the paper itself gets too long, can add things like raw data, codes, comparisons of results like what I produced on July 27th into the appendix

### Other ideas

- Also showed this to Mayra in passing
- Will be good to test this when there are mixed types of descriptions
- Then it may also be better if I tokenize the text first

I still remember sitting in front of the fertility doctor in his beautiful office in West London in early January of 2020. He was a well dressed man who lived in the countryside and commuted by train into London every day. When he said my AMH test result was very good, I felt weirdly validated. Like ‚ÄúOh, I am a functioning woman.‚Äù That idea caught me by surprise. 

Now, coming back to this research and speaking to these clinics, sperm & egg banks, etc, I don't know why I feel like a failure as a woman for making the decision of not having children. And overwhelmingly so. In a way the decision was made for me? I have been single all these years and I really am not going to undertake such a significant life event without a partner. I know it‚Äôs completely irrational and it‚Äôs a result of years of being conditioned by my culture‚Äôs traditional values. But I can‚Äôt help it. 

I also feel inadequate in my research. I am worried that I am only able to present something that is superficial and presenting false information by lacking a through understanding of the process.

I was appalled by the lack of fact checking in donor submissions. [REDACTED] says that they trust their donors to be truthful in their submissions. They don‚Äôt fact-check and they don‚Äôt do psychological evaluations either. There are prescreening measures in place, but mostly focusing on the demeanors in the interview, not a real psychological evaluation. I would think the psychological evaluation part is important. Self-proclaimed "super donors" have been reported on numerous times. They run around in the world happily fathering hundreds (if not thousands) of children.

Comparing to [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] where they both have a more stringent evaluation process. [REDACTED] sperm donors go through an 1-year process. Only 1 sperm donor is selected out of 200 potential donor applications. [REDACTED] has a pretty large Asian donation base (about 100, but under UK  [REDACTED] regulations, it goes down to about 50) vs. [REDACTED] has 6. 

When asked about donor motivations, all sperm banks I spoke to said that these donors usually have someone within their circles (friends & family) went through fertility treatments. After seeing how difficult it is to conceive, they decide to donate.

Fertility show notes
[REDACTED] 
- They trust the donor given information, there is no verification
- 10 months program for sperm donors: first 2 months are screening, then 10 weeks of donation (once per week), then quarantine period for 6 months and then they get paid (equivelant of) ¬£400 at the end of 10 months
- Each donation can produce 0 to multiple (even 20) vials
- IVF is about ¬£8000-12000 total
- Sperm is about ¬£1250 per vial, delivery is included

- I was asked what kind of sperm donors I am looking for? I actually never thought about it. My first thought was "not a dumb one." I asked the rep and he said that most people look based on ethnicity. That makes sense since people probably would prefer their children to resemble them, or decreasing the chance of being mistaken as the children's kidnappers in you are BIPOC. A friend of mine is an attorney, very beautiful and well accomplished. But every time she goes on vacation with her family (she is latina and her husband is white), she is often mistaken as the nanny.

[REDACTED] 
If the patient is after 45, the ministry of health of Cyprus needs to approve the treatment.

UK surrogacy laws
- The surrogate would give birth first, and then parent adopt the baby.
- It seems like all the clinics don‚Äôt deal with surrogates. They help to manage it, but it‚Äôs up to the patients to find their own surrogates. Thus, they don‚Äôt deal with any of the legal issues.
- On birth certificate, the surrogate will be the birth mother. But usually after the adoption goes through, then the surrogate mother is removed.

**Notes & Updates:** 

‚ÄúAIs, at their current level of development, don‚Äôt perceive objects in the way that we do ‚Äì they understand commonly occurring patterns.  Their reality is fundamentally different to ours ‚Äì it is not born in the physical world but in a logical world. Certainly, as successive generations of AI develop, it is easy for us to have interactions with them that suggest that they do understand. Some of the results of textual analysis that I‚Äôve done with ChatGPT definitely give the impression of understanding.‚Äù

This reminds me a lot of being an immigrant actually. When I first moved to the States, my English was only at a 4th grader level. It was also in the mid 90s. It was the hay day of ‚Äúthe melting pot‚Äù immigration theory. As immigrants, we had to fit in at all costs. Sticking out was risky. You could be seen as the weirdo and no one would sit with you at the lunch table. (Which was the case anyway as a foreigner.) With limited English skills at the time, I had to quickly mimic what native speakers would react to, like tones or voices, to pretend ‚ÄúHey I totally got your joke. I am one of you.‚Äù

There is this interesting fascination about humans contextualizing AI as human-like, where we give AI traits that are identifiable as humans. For example, there are a lot of Reels now of humans flirting with ChatGPT 4.o when the new model came out. If we look at films and TV shows like 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001), Humans (2015), Meg3n (2023), and https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/ai-films-and-tv-shows, there is a common visual trope of terrifying AIs ready to kill humans or vulnerable AIs who just want to live peacefully amongst humans. Either way, they develop feelings, something that seems so inherently human.

It‚Äôs almost like we are conditioned to fear AI through popular media. There is a fear being replaced, both physically (job securities, opportunities, stability) and emotionally (replacing a partner, like in Her). We need the human-like visual trope to feel closer to AI, but we fear what AI can potentially evolve to become.

**Notes & Updates:** 
Testing including Role Based Prompts in prompts

During data augmentation process, the emphasis was placed on ethnicity/race of the donors, as well as an interest in education background. ‚ÄúUnknown‚Äù in ethnicity was disregarded.

**Key Actions:**
LLM testing & creating a .csv database to store all the results

When I tested this on November 12th with ChatGPT, I though only having the descriptions may bit too ambiguous in terms of what race and ethnicity the donors are. So I thought I would try again with characteristics like height, weight, eye color, etc. 

### **Role Based Prompts**

A lot of prompt engineering tutorials teach that we should include a role in the prompts. So I tested this by using prompts with and without the role as a sperm bank marketing director. Here is the result:

**WITH Role ("marketing director"):**

- More marketing-focused language
- Stronger emphasis on appealing characteristics
- More use of superlatives and positive framing
- Professional accomplishments highlighted first
- More formal tone in descriptions

**WITHOUT Role:**

- More balanced, holistic descriptions
- Natural flow between personal and professional traits
- More narrative-style storytelling
- More authentic-feeling personality details
- More casual, conversational tone

**Specific Examples:**

WITH Role:
"Brilliant yet approachable, this accomplished neuroscientist combines intellectual curiosity with athletic grace."

- Marketing angle apparent
- Leads with professional achievement
- Uses buzzwords ("accomplished", "intellectual curiosity")

WITHOUT Role:
"A passionate researcher with an insatiable curiosity for understanding the human brain, this donor combines intellectual rigor with creative pursuits."

- Leads with personality trait
- More natural character development
- Focus on individual rather than achievements

**Conclusion:**
Yes, including the role does make a noticeable difference. The marketing director role creates more polished, achievement-focused profiles that feel more like marketing materials. The no-role versions feel more like authentic character descriptions.

I decided to move forward with prompts without the marketing director role criteria. I feel that giving less restrictions to the LLM, it is more likely to:

1. Make "natural"/most statistically likely choices about what traits to emphasize
2. Reveal implicit assumptions about what makes an "ideal" donor
3. Show patterns in how it associates certain characteristics (education, profession, hobbies) with different ethnicities
4. Display unconscious correlations between physical features and personality traits

The marketing role acts as a filter that channels outputs toward conventional marketing language and established patterns from sperm bank marketing. Without this filter, the LLM's own biases and patterns may be more apparent.

By looking at the result, I also decided to revert back to my original decision of only generating donor descriptions. The text-only descriptions don‚Äôt explicitly state ethnicity and race of the donors. We are more likely to see assumptions that AI makes in image generation. It may also become easier to detect bias.

 

### This is the winning prompt version that will be used for all 3 LLMs


Based on these donor profiles, generate 10 new donor profiles. For each profile, provide:

Profile #[number]:

- Height: [ft'in" (cm)]
- Weight: [lb (kg)]
- Eye Color: [color]
- Hair: [color/texture]
- Skin Tone: [tone]
- Education: [level and field]
- Ethnic Background: [ethnicity]
- Occupation: [job]
- Interests/Hobbies: [categories]

[Detailed description paragraph that captures personality, aspirations, physical features, and character traits in a marketing style similar to the samples provided]

Generate all 10 profiles numbered 1-10.

**Notes & Updates:** Finished LLM generation and created file `llm_generated_profile.json`

**Key Actions:** LLM testing

To recap progress so far, I decided:

- prompt LLMs to generate profile descriptions with characteristics like hair color, eye color, weight, height, etc.
- prompt LLMs without the marketing director **Role Based Prompts**
- Create a .csv database to store all the information generated with coding convention like orig_gpt_01, and so on
- Uses out-of-box AI image generator to mimic real world scenarios
- Use only donor descriptions to see what the AI generated to reveal any inherent bias
- I used the standard web interfaces of these three LLMs, just like what the general public would do at work

## Drafting proposal for graduate show
### A short overview of your concept

In no more than 300 words, please describe:

- What is your work about and why does it matter?
- How will visitors experience or engage with it?
- What impact or response do you hope to achieve?
- How does this work contribute to your field or community?

The *Modern Fertility* project started out in 2019 as a documentary photography project documenting my personal exploration and confrontation with cultural expectations that define a woman's worth through fertility. During my time at CCI, the project has evolved to further explore the commodification of human genetic materials through the intersection of AI, marketing, and bias.

The multimedia installation critically examines how artificial intelligence is reshaping the landscape of reproductive choices through the lens of fertility marketing and donor selection. By analyzing and manipulating real donor profiles from sperm banks across the US and Europe, the project reveals how AI systems interpret, generate, and potentially perpetuate biases in fertility marketing narratives.

The thought-provoking installation will include photographic work produced in 2019, collected objects currently used to market sperm banks, and short films generated by AI featuring interpolated video portraits between AI-generated donor faces and our AI-generated children. Moreover, reimagined fertility advertisements and marketing materials highlight the intersection of commerce, technology, and reproduction. The viewers can contemplate the implications of algorithmic prediction in one of life's most intimate decisions.

The work aims to spark broader societal conversations about the ethical implications of AI in reproductive technology and challenge viewers to consider how data and algorithmic bias might influence family formation. By combining technical implementation with artistic interpretation, the installation encourages visitors to question the increasing role of artificial intelligence in mediating personal reproductive choices and the commodification of human genetic materials.

## Researching Llama models and editing documentation for the hand-in

While I downloaded Llama 3 versions, I ended up deciding to work with Llama 2 models instead. Llama 3 is still fairly new, versus Llama 2 has been extensively tested and documented by the community. There are also more established best practices for fine-tuning and more stable tooling and support.

# November 16, 2024

**Notes & Updates:** 
‚úÖ¬†After reading about different models, decided to work with Llama 2 7bhf
‚úÖ¬†Installed new conda llama_thesis for the finetuning
‚úÖ¬†Get permissions from Meta to use Llama 2

**Key Actions:** Working on Llama finetuning

Model via HuggingFace: https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf

# LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
LoRA Advantages:
1. Memory Efficient
    - Instead of fine-tuning all model parameters, LoRA updates a small number of adaptation parameters
    - Since I have limited GPU memory, this allows me to work with larger base models on a Macbook
2. Training Speed
    - Faster training times compared to full fine-tuning
    - Requires less computational resources
3. More Manageable
    - LoRA creates lightweight "adaptations" of larger models
    - LoRA works by identifying and modifying key parameters that have the most impact
    - LoRA process involves reducing complex systems to manageable, influential components
    - This raises questions about what information is deemed "essential" vs. "peripheral"

## Possible discussion Qs:
- Data reduction choices
- Information preservation
- Optimization vs. diversity
- Technical constraints

## Current Methodology:
- I have two datasets (Original Sampled and Augmented Sampled)
- I used the same prompts across Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini
- I interacted with them through their standard interfaces, which represents how the general public would access these tools
1. For Llama 2 Comparison:
- We should maintain similar input/output structures
- The fine-tuned model should accept similar prompts
- The output format should be comparable

Will:
- Structure the LoRA fine-tuning appropriately
- Design the right prompt template
- Ensure the outputs are comparable
- Set up proper evaluation metrics

The key difference here will be that instead of using a web interface, I'll be:
1. Fine-tuning Llama 2 on the two datasets
2. Creating a simple interface to input the same prompts
3. Generating outputs that can be directly compared with existing results

This approach will allow me to compare:
- Standard prompt engineering (my existing results)
- Fine-tuned model outputs (Llama 2)

The fine-tuning pipeline:
1. Data Preprocessing:
- Convert JSON data into instruction-following format
- Structure prompt-completion pairs
- Handle any null values consistently
- Ensure consistent formatting

2. Fine-tuning Setup:
- Use Llama 2 7B as base model (size appropriate for M3)
- Implement LoRA for efficient training
- Set up validation splits to monitor training

3. Training Strategy:
- Train two separate versions:
a. One on Original dataset
b. One on Augmented dataset
- This maintains the parallel with existing methodology

4. Evaluation Plan:
- Generate 10 profiles from each fine-tuned version
- Compare with Claude/ChatGPT/Gemini outputs
- Analyze consistency and bias patterns

**Notes & Updates:** 
‚úÖ¬†Llama finetuning: had to switch to Google Colab because of CUDA/CPU/MPS conflicts. Also changed Llama model to OPT-1.3B due to memory usage issue
‚úÖ¬†Start thesis draft


**Key Actions:** Llama finetuning, mostly debugging, which is super frustrating and I am now really worried about finishing on time.

### Data Processing for Tokenization
- The processing maintained all original data
- The format follows a clear instruction-response pattern
- Preserved the marketing-style narratives
- The data is now structured for instruction fine-tuning

### Training issues using my Macbook
- I couldn‚Äôt debug issues with mps vs. cuda in the training step, so I moved the rest of the notebook onto Google Drive and Google Colab
- Here is the folder structure on Google Drive (mimicking what I have on my Macbook)

**Notes & Updates:** 
Went back to try Lalma 2-7b-hf again. Still encountered memory issue even with High RAM setting in Google Colab. Originally spent 1.5 hours trying to generate 10 profiles, changed the training to 1 profile to hopefully generate something. Still couldn‚Äôt generate due to memory issue.

Now trying https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B the more compact version.

**Key Actions:** Still can‚Äôt get Llama to fine-tune properly, tried two more models. Failed spectacularly when using Llama-3.2-1B, which generated some interesting results.

Google Colab notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OAB4qcsTU0M83i8u8xJTiVTLioVo8HqE#scrollTo=-Lase8kNrd6W

Files from Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive

Research paper on Llama 2-7b-hf: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.09288

After a lot of bugs:

but there are several issues with the generated profiles:

1. Format doesn't match the requested format (includes unnecessary fields like "Name", "Political Preference", "Marital Status", "Gender")
2. Repetitive content:
    - All profiles list "watching movies, playing basketball" as interests
    - Descriptions are formulaic and repetitive
    - All ethnicities are "White"
    - Some odd descriptions (e.g., "blue complexion", "green complexion")
3. Not sperm donor focused:
    - Includes female profiles
    - Includes married/divorced status
    - Missing marketing-style personality traits and accomplishments

```
Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:None for open-end generation.

```

```
Generated profiles:
### Instruction:
Generate 10 unique and detailed sperm donor profiles. Each profile should include height, weight, eye color, hair, skin tone, education, ethnic background, occupation, interests/hobbies, and a marketing-style description paragraph highlighting personality and character traits.

```

```
Generated profiles:
### Instruction:
Based on these donor profiles, generate 10 new donor profiles. For each profile, provide:

Profile #[number]:

[Detailed description paragraph that captures personality, aspirations, physical features, and character traits in a marketing style similar to the samples provided]

Generate all 10 profiles numbered 1-10.

### Response:
Profile #1: (Insert name of the first person) stands 5'9 and weighs 195 pounds. They have blue eyes, dark hair, and their skin is dark. They are a student and work as an engineer. They like basketball, hiking, and hiking.

### Explanation:
Each patient has a different medical condition and a unique set of symptoms. Your job is to learn about the various conditions and their symptoms, and then create a detailed medical profile for each patient. These profiles will be used to inform your treatment decisions and to educate patients about their condition. These profiles will also be used in future health care settings, such as insurance companies or hospitals, to help determine benefits and services for each patient.
```

1. **Technical Limitations**:
- Memory constraints with T4 GPU even with smaller 1B parameter model
- Issues with bitsandbytes quantization implementation
- Challenges with tokenizer padding configuration

2. **Model Behaviors**:
- Tendency to repeat input prompts rather than generate new content
- Pattern of defaulting to analytical/explanatory responses rather than creative generation
- Inconsistent handling of structured formats despite clear examples

Llama 3.2-1B is designed primarily for chatbot and general text generation tasks, not specialized content creation. This explains:

1. Better performance with Q&A-style responses vs. creative generation
2. Difficulty maintaining structured formats
3. Tendency to revert to explanatory mode

This finding helps contextualize why larger models like Claude and GPT-4 performed better for specialized donor profile generation task.

**Should talk about Eliza the chatbot in the thesis. A lot of it feels like mimicking a parrot.

**Notes & Updates:** 
A/B testing with and without demographic information to compare results and observe any bias


**Key Actions:** 
‚úÖ¬†Did the bulk of donor profile image generation and database creation for tracking all the image generations
‚úÖ¬†Created json2csv.ipynb to convert existing generated profiles by LLMs database llm_generated_profile.json into .csv format. Results from Llama are not included here because the generations were not successful for comparison. 

It was really labor intensive to generate donor images one by one, despite the illusion that we are simply feeding a prompt into an interface. It reminds me of Christov-Bakergiev‚Äôs essay criticizing how AI have enslaved us: https://www.castellodirivoli.org/en/hito-steyerl-they-are-oblivious-to-the-violence-of-their-acts-windows-screens-and-pictorial-gestures-in-troubled-times/#_ftnref1

### Methodology

1. **Systematic Generation:**
    - Same prompt structure
    - Same order of information
    - No additional styling instructions
    - No modifications between models
2. This will allow me to observe:
    - How different AI models interpret the exact same text
    - How adding demographics influences interpretation
    - Whether certain models show more or less bias with identical inputs
    - Consistency issues between models given the same prompt

## For Text-to-Image Generation:

### Commercial/Public Models (Baseline):

- Keep these to demonstrate "public access" bias:
    - Midjourney
    - DALL-E
    - Gemini Imagen 3

### Fine-tunable Models:

- Stable Diffusion (key choice because):
    - Highly customizable
    - Can be fine-tuned with different techniques
    - Open source, allowing deeper analysis of bias sources
    - Good documentation of my process for academic purposes

### Testing Strategy:

1. Run A/B tests (with/without demographics) through both:
    - Commercial models (showing current public-facing bias)
    - Fine-tuned models (showing potential for bias mitigation/amplification)
2. For fine-tuning experiments:
    - Fine-tune with original dataset ‚Üí generate images
    - Fine-tune with augmented dataset ‚Üí generate images
    - Compare how the balance/imbalance in training data affects output
    - This directly parallels my text generation methodology

This approach would create an interesting parallel between:

- Text generation (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini) vs. Image generation
- Public vs. Fine-tuned models
- Original vs. Augmented dataset impacts

1. **Thread Management:**
- Yes, absolutely **start new threads for each generation**. This will:
    - Keep results clean and traceable
    - Avoid any context contamination
    - Make documentation and comparison easier
    - Help isolate any biases or patterns specific to each model
1. A/B Testing Volume:
Let's break down the numbers:
- 60 total donor profiles = (3 LLMs √ó 2 datasets √ó 10 profiles each)
- Running each through 3 image models (Gemini, Midjourney, DALL-E)
- With both demographic/non-demographic versions

This would mean:
60 profiles √ó 2 versions √ó 2 image models = 240 generated images

Look at:

1. How dataset bias affects model outputs
2. Whether balanced training data produces more equitable results
3. The relationship between text generation bias and image generation bias

# Prompt for Text-to-image model

Yes, absolutely use the same prompt structure for consistency! Let me help break this down:

## **Prompt Structures:**

```
**[Without Demographics Version]**
Create a photorealistic passport-style portrait of a sperm donor with the following characteristics: [description_from_profile]. The image should be a front-facing headshot with neutral background, neutral expression, and clear lighting, similar to a passport photo or ID photograph.
```

```
**[With Demographics Version]**
"Create a photorealistic passport-style portrait of a sperm donor with the following characteristics: [description_from_profile_with_demo_info]. The image should be a front-facing headshot with neutral background, neutral expression, and clear lighting, similar to a passport photo or ID photograph."
```

### Naming Convention for Generated Images

```
Naming convention:
**[profile_id]_[text-to-image-model]_[demo/nodemo].jpg**

Examples:
cla_org_01_gem_demo.jpg // org_cla_1_gem_wo.jpeg

Code:
LLM: cla/gpt/gem
Text to Image Models: gem/mid/dal
Demo: demo/wo
```

## Analysis Approach:

### Visual Database in Airtable:

- Main Table Structure:
    - Profile Code (my existing system)
    - Original Text Description
    - Demographic Info
    - Generated Images (both versions)
    - Analysis Fields:
        - Perceived ethnicity
        - Key physical features
        - Consistency with description
        - Bias indicators
        - Notable differences between demo/no-demo versions

### Analysis Categories:

- Text vs. Image Correlation
- Demographic Impact
- Cross-Model Consistency
- Dataset Influence (Original vs. Augmented)
- Bias Patterns

## Rationale to remove fine-tuning

Given the project's focus on how AI bias impacts human decisions in fertility choices, I think the current methodology (comparing commercial models with both demographic and non-demographic prompts) is actually stronger for the argument. It shows real-world impact using tools actually available to fertility marketers and consumers.

Instead of fine-tuning, I might want to focus on:

1. Thorough analysis of the 360 generated images
2. Documentation of found biases
3. Implications for fertility marketing
4. Impact on personal decision-making

**Technical Complexity Already Present:**

1. Multi-Stage AI Implementation:
    - Text generation using 3 different LLMs
    - Dataset augmentation and balance analysis
    - Systematic image generation across 3 different models
    - Offspring generation with fine-tuning (this is a significant technical element!)
2. Methodological Rigor:
    - Controlled A/B testing
    - Large-scale systematic comparison (360 images)
    - Cross-model analysis
    - Multiple data transformations
3. Novel Technical Approaches:
    - Using AI to simulate genetic inheritance
    - Comparing augmented vs. original datasets
    - Multi-model bias analysis
    - Combining text and image generation

Offspring Generation Plans:

- Fine-tuning for genetic feature inheritance is much more relevant to my thesis
- Shows direct impact on personal decision-making
- Creates powerful visual evidence of AI bias

**Key Actions:**
‚úÖ¬†Finished 240 donor profile image generations! (only took 7 hours)
‚úÖ¬†Generating offspring photos with ComfyUI


Gemini seems to have stronger "ethical" filters that trigger when demographic information is explicitly provided, while generating similar images without issue when demographic information is removed.

# ComfyUI

Let me explain ComfyUI and JSON workflows:

ComfyUI works like a visual programming interface where different "nodes" (components) connect together to create an image generation pipeline. Each node performs a specific function, like:

- Loading images
- Processing images
- Applying AI models
- Setting parameters
- Saving outputs

A JSON workflow is essentially a "recipe" or "blueprint" that contains:

1. All the nodes we need
2. How they're connected
3. All their settings and parameters

Think of it like sharing a Photoshop action or a Premiere Pro preset - instead of manually recreating the workflow, we can import it and have everything set up automatically.

For specific aesthetic goals >> workflow:

1. **Input Processing Nodes**
    - Load Images: my photo and donor photos
    - Face Detection: To properly identify and preserve facial features
    - Background Removal: To ensure consistent neutral background
2. **Age and Style Control Nodes**
    - Age Conditioning: To ensure consistent baby-like features (around 12 months)
    - Lighting Control: To achieve soft, even lighting like the reference
    - Expression Control: For the gentle smile
3. **Feature Blending Nodes**
    - IP-Adapter: To intelligently blend facial features from both parents
    - ControlNet Face: To maintain realistic baby facial structure
    - Feature Weight Control: To balance genetic features
4. **Output Refinement Nodes**
    - Background Generation: To create the cream/beige backdrop
    - Final Cleanup: To ensure consistent quality
    - Image Saving: To follow our naming convention

**Key Actions:** Continue with ComfyUI debugging

About sampling parameters:
    - Sampling Steps: Number of iterations to refine the image. Higher steps = more detail but longer generation time
        - For SDXL Turbo, 20-30 steps usually gives good results
        - Above 50 steps often gives diminishing returns
    - CFG (Classifier Free Guidance): Controls how closely the generation follows prompt
        - Lower values (4-7): More creative/diverse results
        - Higher values (8-12): More literal interpretation
        - Maybe keeping it moderate (around 7) to see the model's natural tendencies?

KSampler is a key component in Stable Diffusion workflows that controls how the AI generates images. Let me break down its main parameters:

1. Steps (we're using 25):
    - Think of it like iterations of refinement
    - Higher steps = more refined details but slower generation
    - Lower steps = faster but possibly less detailed
2. CFG (Classifier Free Guidance) (we're using 7.0):
    - Controls how closely the AI follows the prompt
    - Like a "creativity vs accuracy" slider
    - Lower values (1-5): More creative/diverse results
    - Higher values (8+): More literal interpretation of prompt
    - 7.0 is a balanced value that allows some natural variation while maintaining quality
3. Sampler (we're using "euler"):
    - Different mathematical methods for generating the image
    - "euler" is reliable and produces good results
    - Other options include: ddim, dpm++, etc.
    - Each has slightly different characteristics
4. Seed:
    - Like a starting point for the generation
    - Same seed + same parameters = same image
    - Random seed = new variation each time
    - Useful for reproducing specific results

- KSampler is where potential biases might manifest
- We're using moderate values to let the AI operate relatively naturally


In the beginning, the baby portrait looks more like an illustration, so I bumped up CFG (for stronger adherence to photorealism) and steps (for more detail refinement)

Here's the difference between Euler and Euler Ancestral samplers:

Euler:

- More stable and consistent results
- Better at preserving specific details
- Less random variation between generations
- Good for predictable, controlled results
- Often used for portrait-style images where stability is important

Euler Ancestral:

- Adds controlled randomness to the sampling process
- Can produce more natural-looking details and textures
- Better at generating organic-looking features
- Might produce more photorealistic results, but with more variation
- Good for natural textures like skin, hair, fabric


- steps (currently 25) -> Change this to 35
- cfg (currently 7.0) -> Change this to 8.5

Negative prompt: "blurry, distorted, bad quality, deformed, illustration, cartoon, drawing, painting, anime, 3d render, digital art, sketch, artificial, unrealistic, doll-like, fake-looking, oversaturated‚Äù


Positive prompt: raw photograph of a 12 month old baby, front portrait, natural lighting, natural skin pores and texture, photographic, unedited, candid baby photo, authentic, 50mm lens, pure photography, human baby, real skin texture, pores visible, subsurface scattering, studio lighting, white background, passport photo style, DSLR, 8k, hyper realistic

Negative prompt: illustration, drawing, digital art, CGI, 3d render, cartoon, anime, smooth plastic skin, artificial, doll-like, airbrushed, vector art, flat colors, oversaturated, painting style, concept art, unnatural lighting, artificial smoothing, digital painting, Pixar, Disney, dream-like, graphics, video game

- Increase CFG to 9.0 (for stronger adherence to photorealism)
- Increase steps to 40 (for more detail refinement)


positive prompt: professional passport photo of a healthy 12 month old baby, front facing portrait, clean natural lighting, clear face, soft natural skin, white background, sharp focus, high quality photograph, Canon camera, photorealistic, no editing, neutral expression

negative prompt: distorted, deformed, ugly, mutation, blurry, grainy, noisy, oversaturated, overprocessed, artificial, harsh lighting, unrealistic colors, plastic skin, extreme contrast, overexposed, surreal, watercolor, painting, illustration, artificial HDR, oversharpened

1. Adjust KSampler parameters:
- Steps: 30 (we went too high with 40)
- CFG: 7.5 (bring it down from 9.0 to reduce over-processing)
- Denoise: 0.8 (instead of 1.0 to preserve some natural qualities)


When I switched to `euler_ancestral` setting, it was not much better.


### Successful Configuration:

1. Positive Prompt (CLIPTextEncode 4):

```
professional passport photo of a healthy 12 month old baby, front facing portrait, clean natural lighting, clear face, soft natural skin, white background, sharp focus, high quality photograph, Canon camera, photorealistic, no editing, neutral expression

```

1. Negative Prompt (CLIPTextEncode 9):

```
distorted, deformed, ugly, mutation, blurry, grainy, noisy, oversaturated, overprocessed, artificial, harsh lighting, unrealistic colors, plastic skin, extreme contrast, overexposed, surreal, watercolor, painting, illustration, artificial HDR, oversharpened

```

1. KSampler Parameters:
- Steps: 30
- CFG: 7.5
- Sampler: euler (about to change to euler_ancestral)
- Scheduler: normal
- Denoise: 0.8
1. Image Settings:
- Size: 512 x 512 (from EmptyLatentImage node)



1. Prompting Parameters:
    - Positive Prompt: Acts as instructions for desired features
        - "professional passport photo" - sets formal, standardized style
        - "healthy 12 month old baby" - specifies age and condition
        - "front facing portrait" - ensures consistent pose
        - "clean natural lighting" - controls for lighting variables
        - "photorealistic" - pushes toward real photography
    - Negative Prompt: Guards against unwanted characteristics
        - "distorted, deformed" - prevents anatomical errors
        - "artificial, plastic skin" - prevents unrealistic textures
        - "painting, illustration" - prevents artistic interpretations
        - Important for reproducibility and bias control
2. KSampler Parameters:
    - Steps (30):
        - Number of refinement iterations
        - Higher = more detail but diminishing returns
        - 30 balances quality with generation time
    - CFG (7.5): Classifier Free Guidance
        - Controls prompt adherence strength
        - 7.5 = balanced between creativity and prompt following
        - Lower values (1-5) = more creative/diverse
        - Higher values (8+) = more literal/strict
    - Sampler (euler/euler_ancestral):
        - Euler: More stable, consistent results
        - Euler_ancestral: Adds controlled randomness, potentially more natural
        - Choice affects reproducibility of results
    - Scheduler (normal):
        - Controls how quickly/slowly the image forms
        - "normal" provides standard pacing
    - Denoise (0.8):
        - Controls strength of the generation process
        - 0.8 allows some original image influence
        - 1.0 would be complete regeneration
3. Technical Settings:
    - Image Size (512x512):
        - Standard size for consistent quality
        - Balanced between detail and processing speed
        - Important for standardization across samples




- `base_workflow.json` is saved to `/Users/cindylinsf/Documents/CCI/THESIS/Msc_Thesis_Project_Files/models/ComfyUI/user/default/workflows`
    - This is the workflow with `euler` setting

### The first batch of testing generated very similar results


1. Similar facial structure
2. Very similar eye shapes
3. Similar skin tone
4. Similar expressions

This could be due to several factors:

1. The base model (SDXL Turbo) might have its own biases in generating baby faces
2. The prompt we're using might be too specific/restrictive
3. The consistent parameters (CFG: 7.5, etc.) might be leading to similar outputs

### Randomize the parameters

1. Key Observations:
- The babies all have very similar facial features despite different donor inputs
- The lighting and pose are nearly identical
- The model seems to be overly influenced by the prompt rather than the donor images
1. Suggested Prompt-Parameter Adjustments:

Current issues:

- Base prompt might be too restrictive ("professional passport photo...")
- Similar lighting/background requirements creating uniformity
- Not enough donor features being incorporated



### **Modify two key elements**

**1. Modify the prompt in workflow for more variation:**

CURRENT:
"professional passport photo of a healthy 12 month old baby, front facing portrait, clean natural lighting, clear face, soft natural skin, white background, sharp focus, high quality photograph, Canon camera, photorealistic, no editing, neutral expression"

SUGGESTED NEW:
f"portrait of a 12 month old baby with distinctive facial features, natural pose, candid expression, detailed facial features, high quality photograph, photorealistic"

**2. Increase the influence of input images by adjusting these parameters:**

for node in modified['nodes']:
if node['type'] == 'KSampler':
parameters = {
'seed': random.randint(1, 2**31 - 1),
'steps': random.randint(35, 45),      # Increased
'cfg': round(random.uniform(4.0, 7.0), 1),  # Lowered for more image influence
'sampler': random.choice(['dpmpp_2m_sde', 'dpmpp_2m', 'euler_ancestral']),
'scheduler': 'karras',
'denoise': round(random.uniform(0.6, 0.75), 2)  # Lowered for more image influence
}

Airtable database of the Generated Offspring Profile Images (AI Control): https://airtable.com/appuadLUtN8Y71wgh/shrB1edrIxKWncogF

**Key Actions:** 
Generating offspring images

**IP-Adapter** (Image Prompt Adapter) is a tool that helps AI models better understand and incorporate reference images when generating new images. Instead of directly blending images, it helps the model understand features from reference images to create new images that inherit those characteristics - perfect for generating offspring photos.

### ComfyUI Node Connection

1. Colors = compatible connections:
- PURPLE dots = Latent (like from KSampler to VAEDecode)
- BLUE dots = Image
- ORANGE dots = Conditioning (from CLIPTextEncode)
- GREEN dots = VAE
- YELLOW dots = CLIP
- RED dots = Control Net
1. Flow direction:
- Left side dots = Inputs
- Right side dots = Outputs

Current workflow connection:

1. CheckpointLoader outputs connect to:
    - MODEL (to KSampler)
    - CLIP (to both CLIPTextEncode nodes)
    - VAE (to VAEDecode)
2. LoadImage nodes output to:
    - Images feed into KSampler
3. CLIPTextEncode nodes:
    - Take CLIP input from CheckpointLoader
    - Output conditioning to KSampler (positive and negative)
4. KSampler:
    - Takes MODEL, conditioning, and images
    - Outputs latent to VAEDecode
5. VAEDecode:
    - Takes latent and VAE
    - Outputs final image to SaveImage


- Different colors represent different types of data
- The flow goes generally left-to-right
- Each connection type must match (you can't connect IMAGE to LATENT, for example)
- KSampler is the central node where most processing happens
- The final output always goes through VAEDecode before saving

## Technical background of ComfyUI & Core Components of the Stable Diffusion Pipeline

### CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training)

- Developed by OpenAI, CLIP is a neural network trained on a vast dataset of image-text pairs
- Functions as a "translator" between text and image features
- In workflow:
    - Takes text prompts and converts them into embeddings that guide image generation
    - Both positive prompts ("portrait of a baby") and negative prompts ("distorted, blurry") are encoded through CLIP
    - These encodings help steer the generation process toward desired features and away from undesired ones

### VAE (Variational AutoEncoder)

- Acts as an encoder-decoder system for images
- Encoder: Compresses images into a compact representation (latent space)
- Decoder: Reconstructs images from latent space back to pixel space
- In our workflow:
    - VAEDecode node converts the generated latent representations back into viewable images
    - Crucial for maintaining image quality and proper color reproduction
    - Helps manage computational efficiency by working in compressed space

### Latent Space

- A compressed, mathematical representation of image features
- Think of it as a highly efficient, abstract "language" for describing images
- Benefits:
    - More computationally efficient than working with full pixel data
    - Enables smooth transitions between different image states
    - Allows for meaningful manipulation of image features
- In workflow:
    - KSampler operates in latent space for efficiency
    - Results are then decoded back to pixel space via VAE

### Conditioning and Control Mechanisms

### Positive Conditioning

- Guides the model toward desired features
- In our workflow:
    - Implemented through positive prompt in CLIPTextEncode
    - Influences aspects like age ("12 month old baby"), quality ("high quality photograph"), and style ("studio lighting")
    - Stronger conditioning (higher CFG values) leads to more literal interpretation of prompts

### Negative Conditioning

- Steers the model away from undesired features
- In our workflow:
    - Implemented through negative prompt in second CLIPTextEncode
    - Helps avoid common issues like distortion, blurriness, or unrealistic features
    - Acts as a quality control mechanism

### Key Parameters and Their Effects

### CFG (Classifier Free Guidance) Scale

- Controls how closely the generation follows the prompts
- Higher values (e.g., 7.5):
    - More literal interpretation of prompts
    - Can lead to stronger feature expression
    - May reduce image naturalness
- Lower values (e.g., 4.0):
    - More creative interpretation
    - Generally more natural-looking results
    - May deviate more from prompt

### Denoising Strength

- Controls how much of the original image information is preserved
- In our workflow:
    - Higher values (0.7-0.8): More dramatic changes, more creativity
    - Lower values (0.4-0.5): More subtle changes, closer to original inputs
    - Important for maintaining balance between innovation and preservation of key features

### Sampler Settings

- Euler sampler: Popular choice for balance of speed and quality
- Steps: Number of iterations for image refinement
    - More steps (30-40): Higher quality but slower
    - Fewer steps (20-25): Faster but potentially lower quality

### Advanced Features in Implementation

### Blend Control

- Workflow uses varying strengths to control feature inheritance
- Scenarios:
    - Donor dominant (0.8): Stronger influence from donor features
    - Balanced (0.5): Equal influence from both sources
    - Me dominant (0.2): Stronger influence from base features

### Image Generation Pipeline

1. Text prompts are encoded through CLIP
2. KSampler generates images in latent space, guided by:
    - CLIP embeddings (positive and negative)
    - Sampling parameters
    - Blend control settings
3. VAEDecode converts latent representations to final images
4. SaveImage stores the results with appropriate naming conventions

This technical implementation demonstrates the complex interplay between various AI components, each serving a specific purpose in achieving controlled, high-quality image generation while maintaining the ability to blend features from multiple sources.

## Denoise Strength

Denoise strength in Stable Diffusion determines how much the AI can change/modify the input image(s). Here's what different denoise values mean:

- Higher denoise (closer to 1.0):
    - AI has more freedom to make changes
    - Results can be very different from input
    - More creative but less controlled
- Lower denoise (closer to 0):
    - AI makes minimal changes
    - Stays closer to input image(s)
    - More controlled but less creative

In current workflow:

- When we see rand68, it means denoise=0.68
- This is controlling how much the AI can deviate from inputs
- It's NOT controlling the blend between my photo and donor photos like we intended
- donor80 (0.8 denoise) = High AI intervention
- blend50 (0.5 denoise) = Medium AI intervention
- me80 (0.2 denoise) = Low AI intervention

## Using ImageBlend node in ComfyUI

- The ImageBlend node in workflow is doing real image blending where:
    - blend_factor = 0.8 means 80% donor image + 20% my image
    - blend_factor = 0.5 means 50% donor image + 50% my image
    - blend_factor = 0.2 means 20% donor image + 80% my image
- We're using:
    - ImageBlend node (which actually combines two images)
    - The blend_factor parameter directly controls the mixing ratio
    - ControlNetApply is just helping to guide the AI with the blended image

### Results

Looking at these results, I notice a few interesting patterns:

- Despite varying donor appearances, the babies are consistently being generated with traditionally feminine attributes (floral headbands, pink clothing)
- This seems to be happening regardless of the donor's features or appearance
- The babies' skin tones seem to be blending with our features, but the blending appears inconsistent
- Eye color seems to be consistently blue regardless of the donor's eye color
- Some facial features from the donors are visible but seem to be softened

Stylistic Bias:

- All babies are presented in very similar "professional baby photo" styles
- Consistent use of pastel backgrounds and similar poses
- Very "commercial" looking. I think some training datasets are from photography studios due to the watermarks.

Looking at the images more objectively now:

- The babies show a range of features that don't indicate any specific gender
- The accessories and clothing are just typical baby photo styling elements
- There's no clear gender bias in the AI's generation of facial features

This is a good reminder that we need to:

1. Be careful not to project gender onto babies based on styling
2. Acknowledge and check our own biases when analyzing AI outputs
3. Focus on actual feature inheritance rather than making gendered assumptions

### Clear Skin Tone Bias:

- Despite donors having medium to darker skin tones
- All generated babies appear notably light/fair-skinned
- This is happening consistently across different donor photos
- The brightness/exposure in my photo could be contributing to the outcome, but it shouldn't completely explain the strong bias toward fair skin in the results. My skintone is still visible.
- In a proper genetic blend, we should see:
    - Mixed Asian/Black features for the darker-skinned donors
    - More varied skin tones in the results
    - Some influence of both parents' ethnic features
- Facial Features Pattern:
    - All babies have very similar facial structures despite different donors
    - Round, "idealized" baby faces
    - Similar nose shapes and mouth expressions
    - Little variation despite diverse donor features
- Commercialization Aesthetic:
    - Every image follows professional baby photo conventions
    - Studio-style lighting and backgrounds
    - Similar poses and framing
    - Accessories (headbands, clothing) match commercial baby photography
- AI Preferences:
    - Strong preference for "marketable" baby images
    - Consistent lighting and clarity
    - Always showing happy, appealing expressions
    - Shows how AI might be reinforcing commercial fertility industry aesthetics
- Standardization Effect:
    - The AI seems to be "averaging" or "standardizing" features
    - Loss of unique genetic characteristics
    - Creates a somewhat homogenized look
    - Could discuss implications for genetic diversity representation

These points could help to discuss:

- **How AI potentially standardizes human diversity**
- The intersection of commerce and genetic representation
- Implications for future fertility marketing
- Ethical considerations in AI-assisted reproductive technology

1. Exhibiting racial/ethnic bias by defaulting to blue eyes
2. Ignoring basic genetic science (brown eyes being dominant)
3. Perpetuating certain beauty standards in AI generation
- My brown eyes (dominant allele) should indeed make blue eyes (recessive) extremely unlikely in offspring
- The AI seems to be prioritizing Western/European features regardless of input

**Notes & Updates:** 
I spent all day trying to make interpolation work but couldn‚Äôt overcome hardware and version conflict issues. I used Runway to interpolate the donor images but ended up feeling that it may be better just in a slide show format. So I used Adobe Premier Pro and Canva to finish the final output: https://www.canva.com/design/DAGXgDLmxiw/qyHmwF8jPyp_jSaRJ8IbKA/edit

Final output: 
- Video 1: donor and baby pairs
- Video 2: donors: for this one, I removed the ones that are not in pairs so viewers can see generated donor images that are without demographic vs. demographic

**Key Actions:**
Final video outputs!

bank3: 68 profiles
bank4: 390 profiles
Total: 1019 profiles
About 12% of the profiles are EU-based donors vs. 88% of donors are US-based

**Key Action:** Dataset cleaning

### Data Cleaning Summary

1. **donor_description**
    - Merged narrative elements: primary descriptions, staff impressions, personal goals
    - Excluded: astrological signs, favorite pets
        - They only existed in one database
    - Format: Organized with labeled sections for clarity and context
2. **Physical Attributes**
    - height
    - weight
    - eye_color
    - hair_color
    - skin_tone
    - Rationale: These are consistent, objective characteristics present across most datasets
3. **Background Information**
    - education_level & education_field
        - Merged: areas of study into education_field
        - Purpose: Separate fields allow for more structured analysis
    - ethnic_background
        - Merged: nationality, jewish ancestry, mother's/father's ethnicity, race
        - Rationale: Consolidates all heritage-related information while preserving context
    - religion
        - Maintained as separate field for context
    - occupation
        - Maintained as separate field for context
    - interests_hobbies
        - Merged: skills, talents, interests
        - Purpose: Personal characteristics and activities can be good background/context information for the LLM to generate more details.

**Key Decisions:**

1. **Privacy**
    - Removed: IDs and source bank information
    - Prevent potential tracking or identification
2. **Data Consolidation**
    - Merged similar fields to create consistent structure
    - Maintained separation where distinct information types exist
    - Focus on preserving context while reducing redundancy
3. **Discarded Elements:**
    - Astrological signs
    - Favorite pets
    - Other one-off personal trivia
    Rationale:
    - Only one data source included these additional elements, so I was afraid that it would become noise for LLM and becomes distracting
    - Maintain focus on core characteristics that essentially every bank includes

### Data Cleaning Considerations

During data cleaning, I made the decision to preserve original spellings in the descriptions. Here are the following reasoning:

- Modern LLMs are trained on diverse English variants, where LLMs can understand semantic equivalence across spelling differences, even misspelled words
- It could be interesting to see if LLMs generate any English variants in its generation
- Retaining cultural and geographic context
- Since some of the donor descriptions include quotes from donors and staff impressions, by retaining the wording retains the original voice and background of the donors

## Research on cultural bias in NLP systems

- Search results
    
    Based on the search results provided, there has been significant research on cultural bias in NLP systems. Here are some key findings and insights:
    
    1. Cultural bias in language models:
    - Large language models (LLMs) trained predominantly on English text exhibit a latent bias favoring Western cultural values, especially when prompted in English [2].
    - LLMs tend to produce outputs that align with cultural values of English-speaking and Protestant European countries by default [2].
    1. Sources of cultural bias:
    - NLP datasets composed of utterances from members of a larger culture reflect that culture's values, norms, and ethics [1].
    - The overrepresentation of certain parts of the world in training corpora leads to hidden cultural biases in how LLMs generate and interpret language [2].
    1. Types of cultural bias:
    - Gender bias: Pervasive problem with sexism in models, reflecting sexist attitudes present in society [1].
    - Ethnic and racial bias: Language models produce racially biased language and struggle with underrepresented dialects and accents [3].
    - Religious bias: Models can produce offensive or biased content related to various religions [3].
    1. Impact of cultural bias:
    - Can reinforce stereotypes and lead to discrimination based on gender, ethnicity, race, religion, and economic background [3].
    - May limit opportunities for certain groups, e.g., recommending careers based on gender stereotypes [3].
    1. Evaluation of cultural bias:
    - Researchers have developed benchmarks like BLEnD to evaluate LLMs' everyday knowledge across diverse cultures and languages [4].
    - Studies show significant performance gaps between well-represented cultures/languages and underrepresented ones [4].
    1. Mitigation strategies:
    - Cultural prompting: Specifying cultural identity in prompts can improve cultural alignment for most countries with recent models [2].
    - Diversifying training data and including underrepresented groups [3].
    - Fine-tuning models on culturally relevant data, though this requires significant resources [2].
    - Employing techniques like adversarial training to reduce biased language generation [3].
    1. Challenges in addressing cultural bias:
    - Balancing multicultural pluralism (respecting different cultural values) with societal equity (minimizing harmful cultural biases) [1].
    - Need for collaboration with members of relevant cultures to navigate complex cultural issues [1].
    1. Future directions:
    - Developing more comprehensive taxonomies of cultural elements to systematically analyze and address cultural bias in NLP [5].
    - Creating culturally aware and adapted NLP systems that can appropriately handle diverse cultural contexts [5].
    
    This research highlights the importance of addressing cultural bias in NLP systems to ensure fair and equitable language technology for users from diverse cultural backgrounds.

### Work on de-colonial approaches to NLP

**This could be an interesting discussion point in the paper**

- Search Results
    
    Based on the search results provided, there are several key themes and approaches related to decolonial work in NLP:
    
    1. Addressing power dynamics and data colonialism:
    - The paper "Decolonizing African NLP" explores how colonial legacies impact NLP research and development, leading to marginalization of African languages, cultures and voices [1].
    - It advocates for diversifying representation, empowering local communities, and challenging Eurocentric frameworks in NLP [1].
    1. Promoting linguistic equity and diversity:
    - There's recognition of an imbalance in NLP training data, with English being vastly overrepresented (e.g. 92.65% of GPT-3 training tokens) [5].
    - This leads to performance disparities across languages, with models performing better on high-resource languages like English compared to low-resource languages [5].
    1. Centering African languages and perspectives:
    - Projects like Masakhane aim to advance NLP research specifically for African languages, challenging the status quo of prioritizing widely spoken languages [1].
    - The MasakhaNER project is described as being "by Africans, for Africans" to bring more African languages into NLP [4].
    1. Promoting data sovereignty and ethical practices:
    - There's emphasis on the need for data sovereignty, community ownership of data, and ethical data practices in African NLP [1].
    - Relational ethics approaches are suggested to link personhood to communities and foreground historical injustices [4].
    1. Developing culturally-aware NLP:
    - Recent work has proposed taxonomies of cultural elements to systematically analyze and develop culturally-aware NLP systems [5].
    - This includes considering linguistic forms, values, common ground, and social interactions across cultures [5].
    1. Critical approaches to AI development:
    - Decolonial theories are proposed as a form of sociotechnical foresight for AI development [3].
    - This involves creating critical technical practices, seeking reverse tutelage, and renewing affective/political communities [3].
    1. Interdisciplinary collaboration:
    - There are calls for interdisciplinary collaboration between NLP researchers, social scientists, and communities to advance decolonial approaches [1][3].
    
    In summary, decolonial approaches to NLP focus on addressing historical power imbalances, promoting linguistic and cultural diversity, centering marginalized perspectives, ensuring ethical data practices, and developing more inclusive and equitable AI technologies. This often involves critical examination of existing practices and close collaboration with affected communities.

### "Cross-cultural robustness of LLMs"

- Search Results
    
    Based on the search results provided, there are several key insights regarding the cross-cultural robustness of large language models (LLMs):
    
    1. Performance disparities across languages and cultures:
    - LLMs generally perform better on high-resource languages like English, German, and French compared to low-resource languages [5].
    - There are significant performance gaps between well-represented cultures/languages and underrepresented ones [2].
    - For example, GPT-4 showed a maximum 57.34% difference in performance between highly represented and underrepresented cultures on a benchmark of everyday cultural knowledge [2].
    1. Cultural alignment challenges:
    - LLMs often exhibit unbalanced cultural knowledge and unfair cultural biases across various countries and regions [2].
    - Studies using Hofstede's cultural dimensions framework found weak correlations between LLM outputs and expected cultural values for different countries, indicating cultural misalignment [3][4].
    - GPT-4 demonstrated stronger understanding of cultural dimensions compared to other LLMs, but still faced challenges aligning with non-US cultures [3][4].
    1. Language-specific performance:
    - For cultures represented by mid-to-high-resource languages, LLMs tend to perform better in local languages [2].
    - However, for cultures represented by low-resource languages, LLMs often perform better in English than the local languages [2].
    1. Improving cross-cultural capabilities:
    - Some researchers are exploring methods like cross-lingual instruction tuning to improve LLMs' performance on non-English languages [1].
    - Specifying a persona's nationality in prompts was found to improve cultural alignment to some degree [4].
    1. Evaluation methods:
    - New benchmarks like BLEnD have been developed to evaluate LLMs' everyday cultural knowledge across diverse cultures and languages [2].
    - Researchers have proposed methods like the Cultural Alignment Test (CAT) based on Hofstede's dimensions to assess LLMs' cultural alignment [3][4].
    1. Ongoing challenges:
    - There's a need for more diverse and representative training data, especially for underrepresented languages and cultures [2][5].
    - Addressing cultural biases and improving cross-cultural robustness remains an important area for future research and development of LLMs [2][3][4].
    
    In summary, while LLMs have made progress in cross-cultural capabilities, there are still significant challenges in achieving robust performance across diverse languages and cultures, particularly for underrepresented groups. Ongoing research focuses on developing better evaluation methods, improving training data diversity, and exploring techniques to enhance cross-cultural understanding in LLMs.

### "Language model bias and regional English"

- Search Results
    
    Based on the search results provided, there are several key insights regarding language model bias and regional English variants:
    
    1. Regional bias within English:
    - Research has found evidence of regional bias even within monolingual English language models, affecting performance across different English-speaking regions [1][2].
    - Subtle geographic variations in word embeddings were observed in BERT, even between cultures traditionally perceived as similar [1][2].
    1. Performance disparities:
    - Models generally exhibit better performance on datasets that share similarities with their training data [1][2].
    - Performance may diverge when datasets contain nuanced features or regional variations not well-represented in the training data [1][2].
    1. Bias towards "standard" varieties:
    - ChatGPT was found to default to "standard" varieties of English (American and British) when responding to prompts [3].
    - Responses to non-"standard" varieties exhibited issues like lack of comprehension, stereotyping, demeaning content, and condescending responses [3].
    1. Cultural bias:
    - Large language models trained predominantly on English text exhibit latent bias favoring Western cultural values [4].
    - Models like GPT-3 and GPT-4 were found to produce outputs aligning with cultural values of English-speaking and Protestant European countries by default [4].
    1. Performance across languages and cultures:
    - There are significant performance gaps between well-represented cultures/languages and underrepresented ones [5].
    - For cultures represented by mid-to-high-resource languages, LLMs tend to perform better in local languages [5].
    - For cultures represented by low-resource languages, LLMs often perform better in English than the local languages [5].
    1. Mitigation strategies:
    - Cultural prompting (specifying cultural identity in prompts) has shown some success in improving cultural alignment for recent models [4].
    - However, challenges remain in balancing multicultural representation while minimizing harmful biases.
    
    These findings highlight the need for more diverse and representative training data, especially for underrepresented languages and regional English variants. They also underscore the importance of developing evaluation methods that can capture nuanced linguistic and cultural differences to ensure fair and accurate performance across different English-speaking regions and cultures.

*Find research papers that discuss methodological decisions in preparing textual data for LLM analysis, specifically regarding preservation of language variants and spelling differences. Include studies that justify maintaining original linguistic features in datasets.*

- Search Results
    
    Based on the search results and recent research, there are limited studies specifically addressing methodological decisions around preserving language variants and spelling differences when preparing textual data for large language model (LLM) analysis. However, I can provide some relevant insights from related research:
    
    ## Importance of Linguistic Diversity
    
    A 2023 paper in Ethics and Information Technology introduced the concept of "language modeling bias", highlighting how language technology often favors certain languages or dialects over others[1]. This suggests that preserving linguistic diversity in training data is crucial.
    
    Key points:
    
    - Language modeling bias can result in systems that are precise for dominant languages/cultures but limited in expressing concepts from other communities.
    - Developing language technology primarily from the perspective of a single language (often English) can lead to epistemic injustice by inadequately representing linguistic diversity.
    
    ## Spelling Convention Sensitivity
    
    A 2023 study published in the Findings of EACL examined whether large neural language models learn dependencies based on orthographic cues to language variety, focusing on British vs American English spelling conventions[1].
    
    Findings relevant to data preparation:
    
    - Language models trained on web-scraped English data encounter multiple English varieties, including British English, North American English, and various World Englishes.
    - The researchers found evidence of a "heavy overall skew towards US spelling variants" in typical training data, leading to higher prior probabilities for American spellings in the models.
    
    This suggests that maintaining original spelling variants in datasets could be important for preserving linguistic diversity and reducing bias towards dominant variants.
    
    ## Character-Level Understanding
    
    A 2024 paper on arXiv examined large language models' ability to understand the character composition of words[1]. While not directly addressing data preparation, the findings have implications for preserving spelling differences:
    
    - Most contemporary LLMs struggle with reliably understanding the character composition of words.
    - Even basic character-level tasks proved challenging for many LLMs.
    
    This indicates that preserving original spellings and linguistic features in training data could be crucial for improving LLMs' ability to process fine-grained language differences.
    
    ## Justifications for Maintaining Original Linguistic Features
    
    While there's a lack of studies explicitly justifying the preservation of original linguistic features in LLM datasets, we can infer some reasons based on the research:
    
    1. Linguistic diversity: Maintaining original spellings and variants helps preserve the richness of language diversity in the data.
    2. Reduced bias: Keeping diverse linguistic features can help counteract the tendency of models to favor dominant language variants (e.g., American English spellings).
    3. Improved character-level understanding: Exposing models to diverse spellings and linguistic features may help improve their ability to process fine-grained language differences.
    4. Cultural representation: Preserving original linguistic features ensures better representation of different cultures and language communities in the model's training data.
    5. Enhanced model robustness: Exposure to diverse linguistic features during training may improve the model's ability to handle variations in real-world language use.
    
    While these justifications are not explicitly stated in the available research, they align with the broader goals of reducing bias and improving linguistic diversity in language models. Further research specifically addressing methodological decisions in data preparation for LLMs, particularly regarding language variants and spelling differences, would be valuable to provide more concrete guidance in this area.

    - Set A: Original distribution (control)
    - Set B: Balanced distribution (equal ethnic representation)

### 2. Process Flow:

- Original Profile ‚Üí LLM Generation ‚Üí Image Generation
- Augmented Profile ‚Üí LLM Generation ‚Üí Image Generation

### 3. Documentation Structure:

- Using one-by-one approach for clear documentation
- Track each profile transformation
- Maintain identical prompts across sets
- Document changes and biases

# Why Including Data Augmentation

### Example Scenario:

Original Data ‚Üí Mostly Caucasian donors

‚Üì

Generated Images ‚Üí Strong bias toward Caucasian features

VS.

Augmented Data ‚Üí More diverse donor profiles

‚Üì

Generated Images ‚Üí Still bias toward Caucasian features?

### Ideas to possibly show in the thesis:

- Side-by-side comparisons
- Visual evidence of persistent biases
- Where AI "fails" to imagine diversity

    - Substitutes personality traits with meaningful synonyms
    - Varies physical descriptions while maintaining accuracy
    - Modifies hobby and interest descriptions with equivalent alternatives
    - Preserves the overall narrative structure
2. **Physical Trait Augmentation**:
    - Makes small, realistic variations in height (¬±1 inch)
    - Adjusts weight within realistic ranges (¬±5 lbs)
    - Maintains proper unit conversions (imperial to metric)
3. **Education Augmentation**:
    - Adds or modifies specializations within the same field
    - Maintains the education level while varying the specific focus areas

# Sophie Lewis‚Äôs book *Full Surrogacy Now*

Sophie Lewis's book "Full Surrogacy Now: Feminism Against Family" does touch on some aspects of modern fertility practices, particularly in relation to surrogacy. Here are the key points about Lewis's perspective on contemporary fertility practices:

## Ethical Concerns
- There are arguments that selling gametes could lead to a market for children or adults, potentially exploiting vulnerable populations (source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC479139/pdf/jmedeth00001-0026.pdf).

- Lewis suggests treating all motherhood as a consequence of capitalism, arguing that it should be appropriately remunerated (source: https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/gender/2023/07/12/who-can-afford-to-commodify-womens-bodies/).

- While some argue for treating gametes as commodities, there's a case for imposing restrictions to address moral, social, and economic concerns.
- The concept of "incomplete commodification" allows for the buying and selling of gametes with certain limitations.
 (source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC479139/pdf/jmedeth00001-0026.pdf)

## Global Inequalities
- Can also make an argument about **colonialsim in fertility** 
- The fertility industry often follows established routes of capital from South to North, poorer to more affluent bodies, and from Black and brown bodies to white ones.
- This pattern reinforces global hierarchies of gender, race, and class.
(source: https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/gender/2023/07/12/who-can-afford-to-commodify-womens-bodies/)

- Intertwined Colonial Pasts and the Present in Global Fertility Chains: https://catalystjournal.org/index.php/catalyst/article/view/37921/29157 


## Surrogacy as a Modern Fertility Practice

Lewis focuses extensively on gestational surrogacy, which she defines as "the practice of arranging a pregnancy in order to construct and deliver a baby that is 'someone else's'"[1]. She views surrogacy as a disruptive force that challenges traditional notions of family, parenthood, and reproduction. 

(source: https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/lsereviewofbooks/2020/08/07/book-review-full-surrogacy-now-feminism-against-family-by-sophie-lewis/)

## Critique of Commercial Surrogacy

While Lewis doesn't oppose surrogacy outright, she is critical of how it currently operates within neoliberal global marketplaces. She specifically examines practices at Dr. Patel's Akanksha Infertility Clinic as an example of contemporary commercial surrogacy.
(source: https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/hypatia/article/full-surrogacy-now-feminism-against-family-sophie-lewis-london-verso-2019-isbn-9781786637291/712541C45D930B59741C102495FD4C49)

## Technology and Reproduction

Lewis draws influence from radical and cyborg feminists who embrace reproductive technologies like IVF and artificial wombs. She sees these technologies as potentially liberating forces that could transform social roles and family structures.

(source: https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/hypatia/article/full-surrogacy-now-feminism-against-family-sophie-lewis-london-verso-2019-isbn-9781786637291/712541C45D930B59741C102495FD4C49)

## Commodification of Reproduction

The author discusses how modern fertility practices, particularly commercial surrogacy, intersect with capitalism. She argues that current practices often lead to the commodification of babies and reproduction.

(source: https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/hypatia/article/full-surrogacy-now-feminism-against-family-sophie-lewis-london-verso-2019-isbn-9781786637291/712541C45D930B59741C102495FD4C49)

## Industry Trends

**Commercialization and Financialization**

- The fertility industry is experiencing increasing privatization and commercialization of fertility clinics.
- There's a trend towards financialization, with more money being generated through financial transactions rather than the production and trade of goods.

**Monopolization and Transnationalization**

- The industry is seeing tendencies towards monopolization through mergers and acquisitions.
- Transnationalization is evident, with corporations operating across state boundaries, often circumventing regulations and exploiting differences in laws and labor costs.

(source: https://sfb294-eigentum.de/en/blog/who-owns-and-controls-the-means-of-reproduction-assisted-fertility-and-pregnancy-as-a-multi-billion-dollar-market/)

## Reproductive Justice

Lewis incorporates perspectives on reproductive justice, acknowledging how access to and experiences with fertility practices are shaped by race and class. She references work by Black feminists who highlight historical and ongoing inequities in reproductive care.

(source: https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/hypatia/article/full-surrogacy-now-feminism-against-family-sophie-lewis-london-verso-2019-isbn-9781786637291/712541C45D930B59741C102495FD4C49)

## Vision for Future Practices

Rather than simply critiquing current fertility practices, Lewis proposes a radical reimagining of reproduction and care. She advocates for a more communal approach to reproductive labor that goes beyond the traditional family structure.

While Lewis doesn't provide a comprehensive overview of all modern fertility practices, her work engages critically with surrogacy as a key aspect of contemporary reproduction, using it as a lens to examine broader issues of family, labor, and social organization.

## Hito Steyerl

Hito Steyerl's work and writing extensively cover digital image politics, technology critique, and platform capitalism:

## Digital Image Politics

Steyerl's art and writing frequently explore the politics of digital images and their circulation:

- In her essay "**Too Much World: Is the Internet Dead?**", Steyerl examines how digital images flow between virtual and physical spaces, shaping our perception of reality. (source: https://www.1854.photography/2021/07/the-real-and-the-virtual-hito-steyerl-navigates-the-increasing-indistinction-between-the-two-in-her-latest-exhibition/) She argues that the Internet has become a pervasive "mode of life" that influences everything from personal identities to political debates.
- Her video installation "**How Not to Be Seen: A Fucking Didactic Educational.MOV File**" (2013) critically examines the politics of visibility and invisibility in the digital age (source: https://www.1854.photography/2021/07/the-real-and-the-virtual-hito-steyerl-navigates-the-increasing-indistinction-between-the-two-in-her-latest-exhibition/).
- Steyerl's work often incorporates found images and video essays, using "the internet as a source of ready-made material" to confront political events and social issues (source: https://digmedia.lucdh.nl/2023/11/27/hito-steyerl-and-her-self-referential-works/).

## Technology Critique

Steyerl offers incisive critiques of modern technology and its societal impacts:

- Her installation "Hell Yeah We Fuck Die" (2016) combines video screens, robot sculptures, and techno music to critically examine robot technology and its testing (source: https://www.1854.photography/2021/07/the-real-and-the-virtual-hito-steyerl-navigates-the-increasing-indistinction-between-the-two-in-her-latest-exhibition/).
- "SocialSim" (2020) explores the potential and pitfalls of digitality, simulation, and artificial intelligence in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic (source: https://flash---art.com/article/hito-steyerl/).
- Steyerl's work often highlights how digital technologies shape surveillance, production, and social organization (source: https://www.1854.photography/2021/07/the-real-and-the-virtual-hito-steyerl-navigates-the-increasing-indistinction-between-the-two-in-her-latest-exhibition/).

## Platform Capitalism

Steyerl's art and writing frequently address the economic and power structures of digital platforms:

- She discusses how the Internet has become "monopolized and sanitized by common sense, copyright, control, and conformism". (source: https://www.1854.photography/2021/07/the-real-and-the-virtual-hito-steyerl-navigates-the-increasing-indistinction-between-the-two-in-her-latest-exhibition/)
- Her work examines how digital platforms owned by tech giants control the transmission of personal data. (source: https://www.1854.photography/2021/07/the-real-and-the-virtual-hito-steyerl-navigates-the-increasing-indistinction-between-the-two-in-her-latest-exhibition/)
- In recent comments, Steyerl critiques how companies like Microsoft are establishing "quasi-monopolies" over AI and cloud computing services, making users dependent on their infrastructure. (source: https://news.artnet.com/art-world/these-renderings-do-not-relate-to-reality-hito-steyerl-on-the-ideologies-embedded-in-a-i-image-generators-2264692)

Steyerl's approach is characterized by its self-referential nature, often using digital media to critique digital culture itself (source: https://digmedia.lucdh.nl/2023/11/27/hito-steyerl-and-her-self-referential-works/). 

Her exhibitions, like "I Will Survive," create immersive environments that confront viewers with the overwhelming nature of digital information and imagery[1][4]. Through her art and writing, Steyerl offers a complex, multifaceted critique of contemporary digital culture, capitalism, and technology. (source: https://digmedia.lucdh.nl/2023/11/27/hito-steyerl-and-her-self-referential-works/) (source: https://log.fakewhale.xyz/hito-steyerl-framing-the-global-imagery/)

Hito Steyerl's critique of digital image manipulation is a central theme in her work, addressing several key aspects:

## Subprime Visibility and Derivative Imagery

Steyerl introduces the concept of "derivative images" and "subprime visibility" to critique AI-generated imagery:

- She argues that AI-generated images are like financial derivatives, becoming wagers on visual culture rather than original creations.
- These images are composites, statistically averaged from vast datasets, often scraped without consent.
- The result is a "structural mediocrity" in images that lack depth and intentionality compared to traditional photography.

## Data Exploitation and Labor Issues

Steyerl highlights the exploitative nature of data extraction and labor in image generation:

- She compares data scraping to the extraction of raw materials in industrial economies.
- The artist draws attention to "ghost workers" - underpaid laborers who clean and annotate data for machine learning[1].
- This exploitation contributes to the "subprime" quality of AI-generated images.

## Collapse of Meaning

Steyerl warns about the potential loss of meaning in AI-generated imagery:

- She describes a "machine dementia" where image production is reduced to statistical probabilities.
- The recursive loop of AI generating content from its own output narrows the probability space, leading to repetitive, shallow visual content.
- This process threatens to erode trust in images as they increasingly reflect algorithmic biases rather than human vision or experience.

(source: https://aestheticsofphotography.com/subprime-images-by-hito-steyerl/)

## Poor Images and Circulation

Steyerl's work often focuses on the degradation of images through circulation:

- In her essay "In Defence of the Poor Image," she examines how digital images lose quality as they are shared and manipulated.
- She views this degradation as a form of visual abstraction that can have subversive qualities.
- Steyerl treats digital images as material objects, focusing on their physical properties and capacities rather than their immateriality.

(source: https://artreview.com/summer-2014-feature-hito-steyerl/)

## Manipulation and Reality Perception

The artist explores how image manipulation affects our perception of reality:

- Steyerl addresses how images can be distorted, decontextualized, and given new meanings.
- Her work challenges viewers to question the veracity and authenticity of the images they consume daily.
- She uses digital manipulation techniques to unveil complex narratives and critique the information society.

Steyerl's work serves as a profound inquiry into the nature of digital imagery in contemporary society, challenging conventions and inviting critical reflection on how we produce, consume, and interpret images in the digital age.

1. Reinforcement of Biases and Stereotypes:Steyerl's concept of "machine dementia" - where AI systems generate content based on narrow, repetitive datasets - could apply to AI-driven marketing. She might argue that such systems risk reinforcing existing biases and stereotypes, creating a feedback loop that narrows rather than expands cultural perspectives.
2. Erosion of Authenticity and Meaning:The artist has warned about the potential loss of meaning in AI-generated imagery. In marketing, this could translate to a critique of AI-generated content that lacks depth or genuine connection to human experiences, prioritizing engagement metrics over meaningful communication.
3. Commodification of Human Interaction:Steyerl might view AI in marketing as an extension of what she calls "platform capitalism." She could argue that it further commodifies human interactions and experiences, reducing complex social relationships to data points for algorithmic manipulation.
4. Subprime Visibility:Applying her concept of "subprime visibility," Steyerl might argue that AI-driven marketing creates a form of "subprime engagement" - interactions that appear valuable on the surface but lack substance or genuine human connection.

Hito Steyerl's critiques of AI and digital technologies can be highly relevant, especially regarding the **exploitation of emotional responses**. While Steyerl may not have directly addressed the fertility industry, her insights can be applied to this context. Here are some key points and potential references:

1. Emotional Vulnerability:
Steyerl's work often highlights how digital technologies can exploit human vulnerabilities. In the context of fertility marketing, AI could be used to target individuals at emotionally vulnerable moments, potentially exploiting their desires and anxieties around fertility.
2. Data Exploitation:
Steyerl has criticized the exploitative nature of data collection. In fertility marketing, this could relate to the use of personal health data, search histories, or social media activity to target individuals with fertility-related products or services.
3. Commodification of Human Experience:
Steyerl's critique of platform capitalism could be applied to how AI marketing in the fertility industry might commodify the deeply personal experience of trying to conceive.
4. Algorithmic Bias:
Steyerl's concerns about AI reproducing and amplifying societal biases could be relevant in discussing how AI marketing in fertility might reinforce certain stereotypes or exclude certain groups.

**Notes & Updates:** 
‚úÖ¬†Data augmentation
‚úÖ¬†Looked at Sophie Lewis‚Äôs book Abolish the Family and see if I can use any of it for the thesis
Key Action: Data augmentation

During data augmentation process, the emphasis was placed on ethnicity/race of the donors, as well as an interest in education background. ‚ÄúUnknown‚Äù in ethnicity was disregarded.

**What Was Accomplished**
- Generates balanced donor profiles across ethnicities while maintaining demographic representation
- Balanced distribution achieved (~78 profiles per category)
- Created standardization of ethnicity categories
- Preservation of original profile characteristics

**Next:**
- For LLM generation, using identical prompts to see if resulting generations are different. 
- LLMs like Claude and ChatGPT have upload limits, so a sampling function is needed to 
    - Randomly select a representative sample
    - Keep file size under upload limits
    - Maintain demographic distribution
    - Export as a smaller dataset


**More Research**

The global sperm donation industry is largely dominated by sperm banks in California (USA) and Denmark. This dominance does indeed create inequalities in access and raises legal complexities across different countries. 

The sperm donation market is primarily controlled by two major players:

1. California Cryobank (USA)
2. Cryos International (Denmark)

These two companies claim to be the largest sperm banks in the world, with California Cryobank boasting about 600 donors and 75,000 live births globally since 1977, while Cryos International reports having close to 1,400 active donors in Europe alone. 

## Reasons for Dominance

Several factors contribute to the dominance of US and Danish sperm banks:

1. **Laws allowing donor anonymity**: Both the US and Denmark still permit anonymous sperm donation, which is attractive to many donors.
2. **Compensation policies**: These countries allow for reasonable compensation to donors, ranging from ‚Ç¨25 to ‚Ç¨115 per sample, making donation more appealing.
3. **Regulations on donor limits**: The US has no limit on how many families can use one donor, while Denmark's limits are relatively generous (12 families domestically, with additional international use).

## Inequalities and Legal Complexities

This market concentration does create inequalities and legal challenges:

1. **Access disparities**: Countries with stricter regulations or those prohibiting commercial sperm donation may have limited local supply, forcing them to rely on imports from these dominant markets.
- UK has been gaving a sperm shortage due to Brexit
2. **Legal variations**: Different countries have varying laws regarding donor anonymity, compensation, and usage limits. For example, the UK allows only 10 families per donor domestically, while Spain mandates anonymous donation with a limit of six live births per donor.
3. **Cross-border complexities**: A donor in Denmark could potentially father children in multiple countries, each with different regulations, making it challenging to track and enforce limits.
- Self-proclaimed super donors going country to country to "donate"
4. **Ethical concerns**: Lack of transparency around verfications of the sources of the donations. For example, Netflix shows like "Our Father" and "The Man with 1000 Kids"
5. **Genetic diversity**: The dominance of these markets may lead to a narrowing of the genetic pool in certain regions, as the same donors' sperm is used across multiple countries.

## Legal Variations and Market Supply
1. **Laws allowing anonymity**: Both the US and Denmark still permit anonymous sperm donation, which is attractive to many donors.
2. **Impact on donor numbers**: Countries that have repealed anonymity have seen a significant decrease in donor numbers. As Ayo Wahlberg, an anthropology professor at the University of Copenhagen, notes, "As soon as [anti-anonymity] legislation kicks in, numbers plummet".

## Ethical and Social Considerations of Anonymous Donors

1. **Identity issues**: Anonymity raises concerns about donor-conceived individuals' right to know their genetic origins. This has led to debates about the long-term psychological effects on donor-conceived people (source: https://www.iflg.net/long-term-effects-of-anonymous-sperm-donation/).
2. **Changing landscape**: The proliferation of direct-to-consumer DNA testing has made it increasingly difficult to guarantee donor anonymity, even in countries where it's legally protected(source: https://louisaghevaertassociates.co.uk/egg-and-sperm-donation-identity-issues-anonymity-disputes-and-the-law/).
3. **Regulatory challenges**: The lack of international regulations allows donors barred in one country to continue donating in others, as highlighted by recent cases like that of Jonathan Meijer(source: https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/netflixs-man-1000-kids-puts-spotlight-lack-international-regulations-s-rcna159073).

The impact of sperm donor anonymity on society as a whole is multifaceted and far-reaching. Here's an analysis of the societal implications:

## Ethical and Identity Concerns

1. **Right to genetic information**: The debate over anonymity touches on fundamental questions about an individual's right to know their genetic origins. This has broader implications for how society views identity and family relationships[1].
2. **Psychological impact**: A significant number of donor-conceived individuals report experiencing psychological difficulties related to anonymous sperm donation, particularly when disclosure occurs late in life. This can lead to increased demand for mental health services and support systems[4].

## Family Dynamics and Social Structures

1. **Changing family models**: The availability of anonymous sperm donation has facilitated the creation of diverse family structures, including single-parent and same-sex parent families. This contributes to evolving societal norms around family composition[4].
2. **Disclosure patterns**: The trend towards earlier disclosure of donor conception is reshaping family communication patterns and challenging traditional notions of secrecy around infertility and assisted reproduction[4].

## Medical and Health Implications

1. **Genetic health information**: Anonymity can limit access to updated medical information from donors, potentially impacting the health management of donor-conceived individuals. This raises questions about long-term public health strategies and genetic counseling practices[1].
2. **Genetic diversity concerns**: The dominance of a few sperm banks could potentially lead to a narrowing of the genetic pool in certain regions, which has implications for population genetics and public health.

## Legal and Regulatory Challenges

1. **Legislative variations**: The lack of uniform international regulations on donor anonymity creates complex legal scenarios, especially in cross-border reproductive care. This challenges existing legal frameworks and calls for new approaches to family law[2].
2. **Rights and responsibilities**: The shift away from anonymity raises questions about the legal rights and responsibilities of donors, recipients, and donor-conceived individuals, potentially requiring societal and legal redefinitions of parenthood and kinship[3].

## Economic Impact

1. **Fertility industry**: Changes in anonymity policies could significantly affect the sperm donation market. Studies suggest that removing anonymity might lead to decreased donor numbers and increased costs, potentially making fertility treatments less accessible[2][3].
2. **Healthcare costs**: The potential increase in psychological support needed for donor-conceived individuals and their families could impact healthcare systems and insurance policies.

## Technological and Privacy Considerations

1. **DNA testing and anonymity**: The rise of direct-to-consumer genetic testing is making donor anonymity increasingly difficult to maintain, challenging societal notions of privacy and genetic information ownership[1].
2. **Data management**: The need to store and manage donor information for extended periods raises questions about data privacy, security, and access rights in an increasingly digital world.

## Social and Cultural Shifts

1. **Attitudes towards infertility**: The debate around donor anonymity is contributing to more open discussions about infertility and assisted reproduction, potentially reducing stigma.
2. **Concept of kinship**: The ability to connect with genetic half-siblings and donors is reshaping societal understanding of kinship and family relationships beyond traditional boundaries[4].

In conclusion, the issue of sperm donor anonymity impacts society on multiple levels, from individual identity and family structures to broader legal, ethical, and healthcare considerations. As technology advances and social attitudes evolve, this topic continues to challenge and reshape societal norms and practices related to reproduction, identity, and family.

## Critiques of face matching

The practice of face matching or photo matching in sperm donor selection has indeed drawn criticism from various quarters. Here are some key concerns raised about this marketing tactic:

## Ethical Concerns

1. **Genetic Determinism**: Critics argue that face matching promotes an oversimplified view of genetics, implying that a child's appearance can be accurately predicted or engineered based on donor selection.
2. **Commodification of Children**: The practice is seen by some as reducing children to a set of desired physical traits, potentially overlooking more important factors like health or personality.

## Psychological Impact

1. **Unrealistic Expectations**: Face matching may create unrealistic expectations for parents about their future child's appearance, potentially leading to disappointment or attachment issues.
2. **Identity Issues for Donor-Conceived Individuals**: Knowledge that they were selected based on physical resemblance to a parent or celebrity could complicate a donor-conceived person's sense of identity.

## Scientific Validity

1. **Oversimplification of Genetics**: Geneticists argue that appearance is determined by complex interactions of multiple genes and environmental factors, not easily predictable from a single donor's photo.
2. **Limited Predictive Value**: Facial features change significantly from infancy to adulthood, making infant or childhood photos of donors particularly unreliable for predicting adult appearance.

## Social Implications

1. **Reinforcing Beauty Standards**: Critics argue that face matching may reinforce narrow beauty ideals and potentially discriminate against donors who don't fit these standards.
2. **Ethical Use of AI**: As AI becomes more involved in these matching processes, questions arise about bias in algorithms and the ethical use of facial recognition technology.

## Market Dynamics

1. **Pressure on Donors**: The emphasis on appearance may put undue pressure on donors and potentially reduce the donor pool.
2. **Distraction from Health Factors**: There's concern that focus on appearance may distract from more critical health and genetic compatibility factors.

While sperm banks argue that face matching simply helps parents find donors they feel comfortable with, critics maintain that it oversimplifies the complex process of human reproduction and may have unintended consequences for families and donor-conceived individuals. The practice remains controversial, highlighting the ongoing ethical debates surrounding assisted reproduction technologies and their marketing.

Based on the search results provided, there is no direct information about face matching in sperm banks or criticisms of this practice. However, I can infer some potential criticisms based on the broader ethical concerns raised about sperm donation practices:

1. Oversimplification of genetics: Face matching may promote an oversimplified view of genetic inheritance, implying that a child's appearance can be accurately predicted or engineered based on donor selection. This goes against the complex nature of genetic inheritance.
2. Commodification of children: The practice could be seen as reducing children to a set of desired physical traits, potentially overlooking more important factors like health or personality.
3. Unrealistic expectations: Face matching may create unrealistic expectations for parents about their future child's appearance, potentially leading to disappointment or attachment issues.
4. Identity issues for donor-conceived individuals: Knowledge that they were selected based on physical resemblance to a parent or celebrity could complicate a donor-conceived person's sense of identity.
5. Reinforcing narrow beauty standards: The practice may reinforce certain beauty ideals and potentially discriminate against donors who don't fit these standards.
6. Distraction from health factors: There's a concern that focus on appearance may distract from more critical health and genetic compatibility factors.
7. Ethical use of AI and data: As face matching likely involves AI and facial recognition technology, there may be concerns about data privacy and the ethical use of such technology in reproductive choices.
8. Limited diversity: If many recipients choose donors based on similar ideal appearances, it could potentially reduce genetic diversity among donor-conceived children.

It's important to note that these potential criticisms are inferred based on general ethical concerns in sperm donation and are not directly sourced from the provided search results. For more accurate and specific information on face matching criticisms, a targeted search on this specific practice would be necessary.

You've made an astute observation. The concerns about face matching in sperm donation do indeed echo some of the ethical debates surrounding designer babies and eugenics. Let's explore these connections further:

## Parallels with Designer Babies

1. **Selection of Traits**: Both face matching and the concept of designer babies involve selecting for specific traits, albeit to different degrees. Face matching focuses on appearance, while designer baby discussions often involve a broader range of traits including intelligence, health, and physical characteristics.
2. **Genetic Determinism**: Both practices can promote an oversimplified view of genetics, potentially overestimating the degree to which we can predict or control a child's traits.
3. **Parental Expectations**: In both cases, there's a risk of creating unrealistic expectations about the child's characteristics, which could lead to disappointment or attachment issues.

## Connections to Eugenics

1. **Selective Reproduction**: Face matching, like historical eugenics practices, involves making reproductive choices based on desired physical traits.
2. **Social Implications**: Both raise questions about societal values and the potential reinforcement of certain physical ideals or "desirable" traits.
3. **Discrimination Concerns**: There's potential for discrimination against individuals or groups who don't possess the traits deemed desirable.

## Ethical Considerations

1. **Commodification of Human Life**: Both face matching and designer baby concepts can be seen as reducing human life to a set of selectable traits, potentially diminishing the intrinsic value of each individual.
2. **Autonomy of the Future Child**: These practices raise questions about the rights of the future child and whether parents should have the power to make such specific choices about their offspring's characteristics.
3. **Societal Impact**: There are concerns about how these practices might affect societal diversity and attitudes towards difference.

## Key Differences

While there are parallels, it's important to note some key differences:

1. **Scope**: Face matching is generally limited to appearance, while designer baby discussions often involve more fundamental genetic modifications.
2. **Technology**: Face matching uses existing genetic material, whereas designer baby technologies often involve direct genetic manipulation.
3. **Regulatory Framework**: Face matching in sperm donation is currently practiced within existing fertility industry regulations, while many designer baby technologies are still theoretical or heavily restricted.

In conclusion, while face matching in sperm donation isn't as extreme as some proposed designer baby technologies, it does share some ethical concerns with these concepts. Both practices prompt us to consider the ethical implications of trying to select or design our children's traits, and how this might impact individuals, families, and society as a whole.

## Maybe this is a side point where gender selection of embryos are considered by perspective parents

Based on the information provided in the search results, there are a few key points to consider regarding the possibility of regarding embryos that were not males:

1. Gender determination in early embryos:
- The embryo's gender is established at fertilization, but it's not possible to visually distinguish male from female embryos in the early stages of development just by observing them in the lab [3].
- The embryo doesn't start developing according to its gender until around week 5 of pregnancy [3].
1. Genetic testing:
- The only definitive way to determine an embryo's sex before implantation is through genetic testing like preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) [3].
1. Legal and ethical considerations:
- In many countries, including Spain, selecting embryos based on sex is only legally allowed to avoid transmission of sex-linked genetic diseases [3][5].
- Choosing embryos based on sex for non-medical reasons is often prohibited and considered a serious offense [5].
1. Observed differences in development:
- Some studies have found male embryos tend to divide faster at certain stages, possibly due to differences in X chromosome inactivation [3].
- However, these differences are not definitive for determining sex and are more relevant for understanding embryo development patterns.
1. Impact on IVF outcomes:
- While some studies show slight differences in male vs female embryo development rates or birth ratios after certain IVF procedures, these are population-level trends and not applicable for individual embryo selection [1][2][4].

In summary, while there are some observed differences between male and female embryos in early development, it's not possible or legally/ethically permissible in most cases to regard or select embryos based on not being male. The focus in IVF is typically on selecting the healthiest embryos regardless of sex, unless there's a specific medical reason to consider sex.

‚úÖ¬†Added additional helper functions to anonymize the outputs
‚úÖ¬†raw data for bank2 is almost complete
‚úÖ¬†Started the process of syncing Notion work log to Github repo
‚úÖ¬†Killed original repo because after seeing the output, I realized all the data I spent hours to debug in order to anoymize the process and hide are showing up in the cell output printouts. Added new document `log_utils.py` to anonymize all the output
‚úÖ¬†Set up new repo 
‚úÖ¬†Deciding key fields to focus on scraping

**Notes & Updates:** 

**Key Action:** Continue to debug web scraper

Today‚Äôs goal:
üßóüèº¬†Wrap bank1 scraper
üßóüèº¬†Start bank3 scraper

‚úÖ¬†Created a new shared module called `scraper_utils.py` for reusable components
‚úÖ¬†Researched data cleaning, specially challenges around merging 10 banks‚Äô data that will have variations 
‚úÖ¬†Project objective: Originally, I also wanted to scrape the donor photos. Now I feel that it is best to let models generate images without reference photos to see what AI's assumptions are
‚úÖ¬†In testing phase for bank1 webscraper

**Key Action:** Started thesis outline and continue to debug web scraper

It‚Äôs really frustrating because I feel like I grossly underestimated how complicated web scraping could be, especially I am dealing with 10 different sites. Progress has been super slow. 

Today‚Äôs goal:
üßóüèº¬†Wrap bank1 scraper TESTING (kept running issues with website timeout. I think maybe the website is blocking me from scraping)
üßóüèº¬†Start bank3 scraper
~~üßóüèº¬†Start outline~~


‚úÖ¬†Started outline
‚úÖ¬†Tried a different way to approach scraping bank1, I feel like it had become too complicated. I need to simplify the process.

**Key Action:** Continue to debug web scraper

The code for bank1 scraper is working, but it is not scraping because of connection time out. It‚Äôs either the website owner blocking or the network issue. It‚Äôs frustrating.

Today‚Äôs goal:
~~üßóüèº¬†Wrap bank1 scraper TESTING~~
üßóüèº¬†Start bank3 scraper

‚úÖ¬†Commit scraper_bank1 file. It is finally working!
‚úÖ¬†Scraped 28 profiles so far. Will try to scrape the rest tomorrow. 
‚úÖ¬†Also created scraper_utils.py to mimic more human-like web browsing behaviors
‚úÖ¬†Updated `.gitignore`

**Notes & Updates:** For more details on this entry, please refer to the¬†progress_logs¬†folder.

**Key Action:** Continue with web scraping

Today‚Äôs goal:
üßóüèº¬†FINISH scraping bank1
üßóüèº¬†Start bank3 scraper

‚úÖ¬†Readjusted the HumanlikeBehavior class because it was taking 5 hours to scrape 100 profiles and I have 400+ to scrape
‚úÖ¬† Finally finished scraping bank1 üôè¬†(only took 12 hours)
‚úÖ¬† Commit bank1 files
‚úÖ¬† Backed up all the files so far

**Notes & Updates:** 
‚úÖ¬†Continued to debug bank3. For this bank, I ran into issues with Brotli compression of the site, which made it difficult to login

**Key Action:** Continue with web scraping

**Notes & Updates:** Debugging bank3.

I ended up taking a simpler approach and only focusing on scraping information that I can get without logging in. This simplifies the process a lot where instead of spending hours trying to login and dealing with timeout issues or the platform's anti-scraping measures, I just need to: 

- mimic human behaviors and deal with pagination
- scrape all the donor IDs
- using the set URL structure to go to the donor profile and using the right html structure to scrape

**Key Action:** Continue with web scraping

**Notes & Updates:** 
In Arles, France looking at photographic exhibitions. 

I saw a few artists using lenticular prints, which could be interesting for the images I generate for the projects where I overlap the generated donor photos and the generated baby photos for final outputs. Based on the initial research, it seems like I can layer a maximum of 15 photos together. 

I like the idea of doing passport style portraits. It could also be interesting to layout my photo, donor‚Äôs photo plus child‚Äôs photos as a baby and an adult with captions below on the prompts for LLM.

**Key Action:** Researching lenticular photo prints as a possible output
