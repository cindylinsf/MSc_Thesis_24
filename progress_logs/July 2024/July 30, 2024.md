**Notes & Updates:** Showed work test so far, went over what high-level needs to look like for the thesis. 

**Key Action:** Meeting with Rebecca #3

### Prompt Engineering

- It may be worthwhile to experiment with different prompts, like least attractive, certain traits, etc.

### Discussion

- Results probably would be better with code where I can fine-tune, instead of using out of the box solutions like Gemini, Claude and ChatGPT, etc.

### Thesis paper

- Why I want to work on this project/ research question
- Process & methodology
- My finding / results
- Conclusions, discussions, etc.
- The theories cited in the work needs to *directly* relate to the work itself
- If the paper itself gets too long, can add things like raw data, codes, comparisons of results like what I produced on July 27th into the appendix

### Other ideas

- Also showed this to Mayra in passing
- Will be good to test this when there are mixed types of descriptions
- Then it may also be better if I tokenize the text first
