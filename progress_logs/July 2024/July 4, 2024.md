# July 4, 2024

**Notes & Updates:** 
1. Start researching and studying web scraping methods. 
2. looking into https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/# for possibly the website building portion. 
3. Deciding MVP version of the project. (Outlined below)

**Key Action:** Project research & outlined what MVP looks like

## MVP Outline:
### Components
---

1. Data Collection and Processing:
• Web scrape a limited set of donor profiles (500 profiles)
• Process and clean this data for use in models

2. Text Generation Model:
• Implement a basic NLP model to generate donor descriptions
• Focus on generating coherent, relevant descriptions based on input demographics

3. Image Generation Model:
• Using generated description to generate images 

4. Simple Web Interface:
• Create a basic Flask web application
• Include a form for users to input demographic information
• Display generated donor descriptions & images

5. Basic Data Visualization:
• Implement one simple visualization (like a bar chart showing potential half-siblings, cousins, etc.)

6. Minimal Database:
• Store generated profiles and user interactions

### User Flow:
1. User enters demographic information on the website
2. System generates a donor description using the NLP model
3. Website displays the generated description and a basic visualization
4. Save the interaction in the database

### Next steps
- Audio Generation
- Face Matching
- Complex Data Visualizations
- Advanced User Interaction:
    - Participants can select donors and match with their choice
    - Printing a composite of their AI baby by taking a photo via computer webcam, combining with the AI generated donor’s baby photo
