**Notes & Updates:** 
Created a Google Doc draft for the participant waiver.

Updated MVP version:
• Most of it is still the same: Scraping donor profiles, training models for text generation, donor photo generation and still possibly audio & video
• Instead of building a public interactive website, just use my own photos as in put for the deliverables

**Key Action:**
- Brief chat with Rebecca via Slack Huddle about going for the minimum viable version the project. 
- Updated ethics paperwork accordingly.
